      "To solve this block-moving puzzle, we employ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS is ideal for finding the **shortest sequence of moves** that transforms the initial configuration of stacks into the goal configuration. Each move is defined as transferring the **top block** of one stack to **any other allowed location**.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Only the **top block** of a stack can be moved.\n",
      "2. Blocks can be placed either on an **empty stack** or on top of **another block**.\n",

      "- **Visited States**: To avoid revisiting the same state, we use a `set`.\n",
      "- **Queue Structure**: The BFS queue contains tuples of the form `(current_state, moves_so_far)`.\n",
