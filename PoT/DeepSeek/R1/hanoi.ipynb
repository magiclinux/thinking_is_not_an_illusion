      "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we use a recursive approach that efficiently moves disks from the source peg to the target peg while adhering to the rules of the puzzle. The solution leverages the classic recursive algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi, which involves moving `n-1` disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the largest disk to the target peg, and then moving the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves moving a stack of disks of different sizes from the initial peg (peg 0) to the target peg (peg 2) using an auxiliary peg (peg 1). The key constraints are:\n",
      "   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
      "   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
      "   - Only the top disk of any peg can be moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Intuition**: The recursive solution breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems:\n",
      "   - Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n",
      "   - Move the largest disk (disk `n`) from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "   - Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Algorithm Selection**: The recursive algorithm efficiently handles the problem by reducing it to smaller instances. The base case occurs when only one disk needs to be moved, which is done directly from the source to the target peg.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of the solution is \\(O(2^n)\\) because each recursive call generates two more calls until the base case is reached. The space complexity is \\(O(n)\\) due to the recursion stack depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution Code\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def solution(n):\n",
      "    moves = []\n",
      "    \n",
      "    def _hanoi(n, from_peg, to_peg, aux_peg):\n",
      "        if n == 1:\n",
      "            moves.append([1, from_peg, to_peg])\n",
      "        else:\n",
      "            _hanoi(n-1, from_peg, aux_peg, to_peg)\n",
      "            moves.append([n, from_peg, to_peg])\n",
      "            _hanoi(n-1, aux_peg, to_peg, from_peg)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    _hanoi(n, 0, 2, 1)\n",
      "    return moves\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Initialization**: The `solution` function initializes an empty list `moves` to store the sequence of moves.\n",
      "2. **Recursive Helper Function**: The `_hanoi` function is defined within `solution` to handle the recursive moves:\n",
      "   - **Base Case**: If only one disk remains (`n == 1`), it moves the disk directly from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "   - **Recursive Case**: For `n > 1`:\n",
      "     - Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg using the target peg as temporary storage.\n",
      "     - Move the largest disk (`n`) from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "     - Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg using the source peg as temporary storage.\n",
      "3. **Initial Call**: The initial call to `_hanoi` starts with moving `n` disks from peg 0 to peg 2, using peg 1 as the auxiliary peg.\n",
      "4. **Return Result**: The function returns the list `moves`, which contains all the moves in the required format `[disk_id, from_peg, to_peg]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging recursion to break down the problem into manageable subproblems, ensuring all constraints are met while generating the optimal sequence of moves.\n"
