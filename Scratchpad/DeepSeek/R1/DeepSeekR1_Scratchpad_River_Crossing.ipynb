Initially, all actors and agents are on the left side of the river with the boat. How should they cross the river? (Note: the boat cannot travel empty)\n",

The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**.

The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**.

Initially, all actors and agents are on the left side of the river with the boat. How should they cross the river? (Note: the boat cannot travel empty)\n",

The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**.

In your next round of conversation, you can use the scratchpad to recover your memory of the current round.\n",

The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**.
