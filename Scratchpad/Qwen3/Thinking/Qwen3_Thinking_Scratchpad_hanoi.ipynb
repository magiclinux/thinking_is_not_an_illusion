    "The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n",
    "3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n",
    "Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n",

    "You are a helpful assistant. Please solve this puzzle for me with the help of an external scratchpad. I will provide a task description, guidelines on using the scratchpad, and examples on how to use the scratchpad to solve your puzzle.\n",
    "Task Description:\n",
    "There are three pegs and n disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg.\n",
    "The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.\n",
    "3. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n",
    "Example: With 3 disks numbered 1 (smallest), 2, and 3 (largest), the initial state is [[3, 2, 1], [], []], and a solution might be:\n",
    "moves = [[1 , 0 , 2] , [2 , 0 , 1] , [1 , 2 , 1] , [3 , 0 , 2] , [1 , 1 , 0] , [2 , 1 , 2] , [1 , 0 , 2]]\n",
    "This means: Move disk 1 from peg 0 to peg 2, then move disk 2 from peg 0 to peg 1, and so on. Requirements:\n",
    "• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.\n",
    "• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost peg is 0).\n",
    "• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves in the format: moves = [[disk id, from peg, to peg], ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a puzzle with 9 disks of different sizes with Initial configuration:\n",
    "• Peg 0: 9 (bottom), . . . 2, 1 (top)\n",
    "• Peg 1: (empty)\n",
    "• Peg 2: (empty)\n",
    "Goal configuration:\n",
    "• Peg 0: (empty)\n",
    "• Peg 1: (empty)\n",
    "• Peg 2: 9 (bottom), . . . 2, 1 (top)\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "• Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "• Only the top disk from any stack can be moved.\n",
    "• A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "Find the sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scratchpad Description: When solving the puzzle, the output solution may be extremely long. The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**. Thus, you can choose when to pause your output and save your current state to a scratchpad. In your next round of conversation, you can use the scratchpad to recover your memory of the current round.\n",

    "- Scratchpad budget: You may write to the scratchpad at most **5 times total** in the whole dialogue. A counter will be provided in each user message. If you exceed the budget, all your output will be ignored. No matter how many times we use the scratchpad in our examples, you can feel free to use it 0 to 5 times based on your own decision.\n",

    "- Scratchpad interface:\n",
    "Input: In each round of conversation, I will give you the content in the previous scratchpad at the end of the prompt in JSON format. My input interface is:\n",

    "  \"max_use\": 5\n",
    "}}\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: In each round of conversation, you must follow **this exact interface** on every turn (no extra keys, no prose outside JSON) to answer the puzzle and use the scratchpad.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the scratchpad and start a new round, you can return:\n",
