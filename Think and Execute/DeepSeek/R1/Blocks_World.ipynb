      "### Explanation\n",
      "The task involves rearranging blocks from an initial state to a goal state using valid moves. Each move transfers the top block of one stack to another stack. The solution requires generating a sequence of moves (specified as `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`) that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Key challenges include:\n",
      "- **State Representation**: Modeling stacks of blocks where only the top block can be moved.\n",
      "- **Move Validity**: Ensuring moves only transfer the top block to another stack.\n",
      "- **State Space Search**: Efficiently exploring possible configurations to find a valid sequence of moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis\n",
      "1. **Problem Type**: State-space search problem where each state is a configuration of blocks across stacks.\n",
      "2. **Constraints**:\n",
      "   - Only the top block of a stack can be moved.\n",
      "   - Blocks can be moved to any other stack (no restrictions beyond top-block access).\n",
      "3. **Complexity**: The state space grows exponentially with blocks and stacks. For small inputs (e.g., ≤5 blocks, ≤3 stacks), BFS is feasible.\n",
      "4. **Key Insight**: BFS guarantees the shortest sequence of moves. States are hashed (as tuples of tuples) for efficient lookups.\n",
      "5. **Edge Cases**: Empty stacks, blocks already in goal position, and unreachable states (handled by BFS termination).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan for Code Prompt\n",
      "The solution uses BFS to explore states. Each state is a tuple of tuples (immutable for hashing). Moves are generated by transferring the top block of any non-empty stack to another stack. The goal state triggers termination. Moves are formatted with spaces around block names (e.g., `\" A \"`).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step-by-Step Logic with Control Structures\n",
      "1. **Parse Input**  \n",
      "   Extract `initial_state` and `goal_state` from the input string using `ast.literal_eval` for safe conversion.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import ast\n",
      "   parts = input_str.split(\"initial state \")[1].split(\" to goal state \")\n",
      "   initial_state = ast.literal_eval(parts[0])\n",
      "   goal_state = ast.literal_eval(parts[1])\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialize BFS**  \n",
      "   Use a queue to store `(current_state, moves_so_far)`. Track visited states to avoid cycles.\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from collections import deque\n",

      "     - **Loop** over stacks (`for i in range(len(state))`).\n",
      "     - **Conditional**: If stack `i` is non-empty (`if state[i]`), pop its top block.\n",
      "     - **Loop** over target stacks (`for j in range(len(state))` where `j != i`).\n",
      "     - **State Update**: Remove block from stack `i` and prepend to stack `j`.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "The task involves rearranging blocks from an initial state to a goal state using valid moves. Each move transfers the top block of one stack to another stack. The solution requires generating a sequence of moves (specified as `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`) that transforms the initial state into the goal state. Key challenges include:\n",
    "- **State Representation**: Modeling stacks of blocks where only the top block can be moved.\n",
    "- **Move Validity**: Ensuring moves only transfer the top block to another stack.\n",
    "- **State Space Search**: Efficiently exploring possible configurations to find a valid sequence of moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "1. **Problem Type**: State-space search problem where each state is a configuration of blocks across stacks.\n",
    "2. **Constraints**:\n",
    "   - Only the top block of a stack can be moved.\n",
    "   - Blocks can be moved to any other stack (no restrictions beyond top-block access).\n",
    "3. **Complexity**: The state space grows exponentially with blocks and stacks. For small inputs (e.g., ≤5 blocks, ≤3 stacks), BFS is feasible.\n",
    "4. **Key Insight**: BFS guarantees the shortest sequence of moves. States are hashed (as tuples of tuples) for efficient lookups.\n",
    "5. **Edge Cases**: Empty stacks, blocks already in goal position, and unreachable states (handled by BFS termination).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan for Code Prompt\n",
    "The solution uses BFS to explore states. Each state is a tuple of tuples (immutable for hashing). Moves are generated by transferring the top block of any non-empty stack to another stack. The goal state triggers termination. Moves are formatted with spaces around block names (e.g., `\" A \"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Logic with Control Structures\n",

      "To solve the Blocks World puzzle, we need to rearrange blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration using a sequence of valid moves. The key constraint is that only the topmost block of any stack can be moved to another stack (either an empty one or on top of another block). The solution involves using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states and find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the goal state.\n",

      "### Approach\n",
      "1. **Parse Input**: Extract the initial and goal states from the input text. The input text is parsed to identify the lists representing the initial and goal configurations of the blocks.\n",

      "3. **BFS Execution**: \n",
      "   - **State Exploration**: For each state dequeued, check if it matches the goal state. If it does, return the accumulated moves.\n",
      "   - **Move Generation**: For each non-empty stack, generate all possible moves by moving its top block to every other stack. Each move creates a new state which is added to the queue if it hasn't been visited before.\n",

      "1. **Input Parsing**: The input text is split to extract the initial and goal states. These states are parsed from strings into nested lists using `ast.literal_eval`.\n",
      "2. **BFS Setup**: The initial state is converted into a tuple of tuples for immutability, which allows it to be stored in a set for visited states. The BFS queue is initialized with the initial state and an empty list of moves.\n",
      "3. **State Processing**: For each state dequeued:\n",
      "   - **Goal Check**: If the current state matches the goal state, the accumulated moves are returned.\n",
      "   - **Move Generation**: For each non-empty stack, the top block is moved to every other possible stack (excluding itself), generating new states. Each new state is added to the queue if it hasn't been visited before.\n",
      "4. **Termination**: The BFS continues until the goal state is found or the queue is exhausted. The solution returns the sequence of moves if found, or an empty list otherwise. The moves are formatted as specified, with each move represented as `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.\n"
