      "### Explanation\n",
      "The task involves solving the checker jumping puzzle for a given `n`, where the goal is to exchange the positions of red (`R`) and blue (`B`) checkers on a linear board of size `2n+1` slots. The initial configuration has `n` reds on the left, an empty slot in the middle (position `n`), and `n` blues on the right. The target configuration reverses this, with blues on the left and reds on the right. Moves allow a checker to slide to an adjacent empty slot or jump over a single checker of the opposite color into an empty slot. The solution requires listing every move in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis\n",
      "1. **Problem Complexity**: The puzzle is solved by generating a sequence of moves. For small `n` (like the examples: 2, 3, 4), solutions can be precomputed or found via BFS. For larger `n`, BFS is used to ensure correctness, though the state space grows as `(2n+1) * C(2n, n)` (manageable for `n ≤ 4`).\n",
      "2. **Key Challenges**:\n",
      "   - Parsing `n` from the input string.\n",
      "   - Generating valid moves (slides/jumps) while tracking the board state and empty slot.\n",
      "   - Ensuring the solution matches the target configuration.\n",
      "   - Formatting the output as a list of moves with specific indentation.\n",
      "3. **Insights**: \n",
      "   - For `n=1` and `n=2`, precomputed sequences match the classic solution.\n",
      "   - For `n≥3`, BFS efficiently finds a shortest path. Moves are generated in order: left-slide, right-slide, left-jump, right-jump.\n",
      "   - State representation uses tuples of the board for hashability in BFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan to Generate Code Prompt\n",
      "The code will parse `n`, use precomputed moves for `n=1-2`, and BFS for `n≥3`. The output is formatted as a list of `[piece, from_pos, to_pos]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step-by-Step Logic with Control Structures\n",
      "1. **Parse `n` from input**:\n",
      "   - Use regex to extract `n` from the input string (e.g., `$n=2$` → `n=2`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Precomputed sequences for small `n` (if-else)**:\n",
      "   - If `n == 1`: Use the fixed sequence `[ ['R',0,1], ['B',2,0] ]`.\n",
      "   - Else if `n == 2`: Use the fixed sequence from the example.\n",
      "   - Else: Use BFS to compute moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **BFS for `n ≥ 3` (loop and state tracking)**:\n",
      "   - **Initialize**:\n",
      "     - Board: `['R']*n + ['_'] + ['B']*n`.\n",
      "     - Target: `['B']*n + ['_'] + ['R']*n`.\n",
      "     - Queue: Stores tuples `(board_tuple, empty_index, move_sequence)`.\n",
      "     - Visited set: Prevents revisiting states.\n",
      "   - **BFS Loop (while queue not empty)**:\n",
      "     - Dequeue a state.\n",
      "     - If board matches target, return the move sequence.\n",
      "     - **Generate moves (loop through neighbors)**:\n",
      "       - **Slides**: Check adjacent left/right positions.\n",
      "       - **Jumps**: Check positions two slots away if the middle checker is the opposite color.\n",
      "     - For each valid move:\n",
      "       - Update the board and empty slot.\n",
      "       - Append the move `[piece, from_pos, to_pos]` to the sequence.\n",
      "       - Enqueue the new state if not visited.\n",
      "   - **Termination**: Return the move sequence when the target is found.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output formatting (dictionary not needed, but string manipulation)**:\n",
      "   - Format moves as strings: `\"['X', from, to]\"`.\n",
      "   - Join with newlines and indentation. Ensure no trailing comma on the last move.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "The task involves solving the checker jumping puzzle for a given `n`, where the goal is to exchange the positions of red (`R`) and blue (`B`) checkers on a linear board of size `2n+1` slots. The initial configuration has `n` reds on the left, an empty slot in the middle (position `n`), and `n` blues on the right. The target configuration reverses this, with blues on the left and reds on the right. Moves allow a checker to slide to an adjacent empty slot or jump over a single checker of the opposite color into an empty slot. The solution requires listing every move in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "1. **Problem Complexity**: The puzzle is solved by generating a sequence of moves. For small `n` (like the examples: 2, 3, 4), solutions can be precomputed or found via BFS. For larger `n`, BFS is used to ensure correctness, though the state space grows as `(2n+1) * C(2n, n)` (manageable for `n ≤ 4`).\n",
    "2. **Key Challenges**:\n",
    "   - Parsing `n` from the input string.\n",
    "   - Generating valid moves (slides/jumps) while tracking the board state and empty slot.\n",
    "   - Ensuring the solution matches the target configuration.\n",
    "   - Formatting the output as a list of moves with specific indentation.\n",
    "3. **Insights**:\n",
    "   - For `n=1` and `n=2`, precomputed sequences match the classic solution.\n",
    "   - For `n≥3`, BFS efficiently finds a shortest path. Moves are generated in order: left-slide, right-slide, left-jump, right-jump.\n",
    "   - State representation uses tuples of the board for hashability in BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan to Generate Code Prompt\n",
    "The code will parse `n`, use precomputed moves for `n=1-2`, and BFS for `n≥3`. The output is formatted as a list of `[piece, from_pos, to_pos]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Logic with Control Structures\n",
    "1. **Parse `n` from input**:\n",
    "   - Use regex to extract `n` from the input string (e.g., `$n=2$` → `n=2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precomputed sequences for small `n` (if-else)**:\n",
    "   - If `n == 1`: Use the fixed sequence `[ ['R',0,1], ['B',2,0] ]`.\n",
    "   - Else if `n == 2`: Use the fixed sequence from the example.\n",
    "   - Else: Use BFS to compute moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BFS for `n ≥ 3` (loop and state tracking)**:\n",
    "   - **Initialize**:\n",
    "     - Board: `['R']*n + ['_'] + ['B']*n`.\n",
    "     - Target: `['B']*n + ['_'] + ['R']*n`.\n",
    "     - Queue: Stores tuples `(board_tuple, empty_index, move_sequence)`.\n",
    "     - Visited set: Prevents revisiting states.\n",
    "   - **BFS Loop (while queue not empty)**:\n",
    "     - Dequeue a state.\n",
    "     - If board matches target, return the move sequence.\n",
    "     - **Generate moves (loop through neighbors)**:\n",
    "       - **Slides**: Check adjacent left/right positions.\n",
    "       - **Jumps**: Check positions two slots away if the middle checker is the opposite color.\n",
    "     - For each valid move:\n",
    "       - Update the board and empty slot.\n",
    "       - Append the move `[piece, from_pos, to_pos]` to the sequence.\n",
    "       - Enqueue the new state if not visited.\n",
    "   - **Termination**: Return the move sequence when the target is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output formatting (dictionary not needed, but string manipulation)**:\n",
    "   - Format moves as strings: `\"['X', from, to]\"`.\n",
    "   - Join with newlines and indentation. Ensure no trailing comma on the last move.\n",

      "2. **Conditional Logic**: \n",
      "   - Uses precomputed sequences for n=1 and n=2\n",
      "   - Falls back to BFS for n≥3\n",
      "3. **BFS Implementation**:\n",
      "   - Tracks board states as tuples for hashing\n",
      "   - Stores (board, empty_index, path) in queue\n",
      "   - Validates moves based on direction and jump rules\n",
      "4. **Detailed Output**:\n",
      "   - Prints extracted n value\n",
      "   - Shows initial/target configurations\n",
      "   - Outputs BFS progress at key depths\n",
      "   - Displays final move count and sequence\n",
      "5. **State Tracking**:\n",
      "   - Uses dictionary-like set for visited states\n",
      "   - Maintains path with each state\n",
      "   - Tracks empty slot position for efficient move generation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Usage Example:\n",
      "```python\n",

      "moves = solve_checker(input_text)\n",
      "print(\"moves = \" + str(moves))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output Format:\n",
      "Returns a list of moves in format `[['R', from, to], ...]` that can be directly printed. For multiple-choice questions (not applicable here), the output would be formatted as '(X)' options.\n"
