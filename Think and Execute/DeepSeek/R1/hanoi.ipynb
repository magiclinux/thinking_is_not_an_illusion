      "### Explanation for Example 4 (Tower of Hanoi Moves)\n",
      "**Core Task**: Generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for `n` disks, moving from a specified start peg to a target peg. Each move is represented as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`. The solution must account for:\n",
      "- **Disk numbering**: Disks are numbered 1 (smallest) to `n` (largest).\n",
      "- **Peg conventions**: Pegs are labeled 0, 1, or 2.\n",
      "- **Recursive logic**: The solution leverages the classic recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Challenges**:\n",
      "1. **Parsing input**: Extract `n`, `source_peg`, and `target_peg` from text with variable formatting (e.g., \"$n=3$\").\n",
      "2. **Determining auxiliary peg**: Compute the third peg not used as source/target.\n",
      "3. **Generating moves**: Use recursion to break the problem into subproblems (move `n-1` disks → move largest disk → move `n-1` disks back).\n",
      "4. **Output formatting**: Match the exact list-of-lists structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis and Plan\n",
      "#### Step 1: Parse Input with Regex\n",
      "- **Logic**: Use regex to extract:\n",
      "  - `n`: Search for `r'n=(\\d+)'` (digits after \"n=\").\n",
      "  - `source_peg`/`target_peg`: Search for `r'from peg \\$?(\\d+)'` and `r'to peg \\$?(\\d+)'` (digits after \"from/to peg\", ignoring optional \"$\").\n",
      "- **Condition Handling**:\n",
      "  - **If** regex matches fail → return error.\n",
      "  - **Else** → proceed with extracted integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Compute Auxiliary Peg\n",
      "- **Logic**: Pegs are always {0, 1, 2}. Auxiliary = remaining peg after removing source and target.\n",
      "- **Dictionary Use**: Represent pegs as a set. Subtract `{source_peg, target_peg}` from `{0, 1, 2}` → remaining peg is auxiliary.\n",
      "- **Edge Case**: If source = target → invalid (handled by input parsing).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Recursive Move Generation\n",
      "- **Base Case** (`n == 1`): Directly move disk 1 from source to target.\n",
      "- **Recursive Case** (`n > 1`):\n",
      "  1. Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary (using target as temp).\n",
      "  2. Move disk `n` from source to target.\n",
      "  3. Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to target (using source as temp).\n",
      "- **Loop Simulation**: Recursion inherently processes repetitive subproblems (equivalent to a loop stack).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Output Formatting\n",
      "- **Structure**: Convert the move list to a string with `str(moves_list)`.\n",
      "- **Final Output**: Prepend `\"moves = \"` to match the required format.\n",

    "- **Peg conventions**: Pegs are labeled 0, 1, or 2.\n",
    "- **Recursive logic**: The solution leverages the classic recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Challenges**:\n",
    "1. **Parsing input**: Extract `n`, `source_peg`, and `target_peg` from text with variable formatting (e.g., \"$n=3$\").\n",
    "2. **Determining auxiliary peg**: Compute the third peg not used as source/target.\n",
    "3. **Generating moves**: Use recursion to break the problem into subproblems (move `n-1` disks → move largest disk → move `n-1` disks back).\n",

    "### Analysis and Plan\n",
    "#### Step 1: Parse Input with Regex\n",
    "- **Logic**: Use regex to extract:\n",
    "  - `n`: Search for `r'n=(\\d+)'` (digits after \"n=\").\n",
    "  - `source_peg`/`target_peg`: Search for `r'from peg \\$?(\\d+)'` and `r'to peg \\$?(\\d+)'` (digits after \"from/to peg\", ignoring optional \"$\").\n",
    "- **Condition Handling**:\n",
    "  - **If** regex matches fail → return error.\n",
    "  - **Else** → proceed with extracted integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Compute Auxiliary Peg\n",
    "- **Logic**: Pegs are always {0, 1, 2}. Auxiliary = remaining peg after removing source and target.\n",
    "- **Dictionary Use**: Represent pegs as a set. Subtract `{source_peg, target_peg}` from `{0, 1, 2}` → remaining peg is auxiliary.\n",
    "- **Edge Case**: If source = target → invalid (handled by input parsing).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Recursive Move Generation\n",
    "- **Base Case** (`n == 1`): Directly move disk 1 from source to target.\n",
    "- **Recursive Case** (`n > 1`):\n",
    "  1. Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary (using target as temp).\n",
    "  2. Move disk `n` from source to target.\n",
    "  3. Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to target (using source as temp).\n",
    "- **Loop Simulation**: Recursion inherently processes repetitive subproblems (equivalent to a loop stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Output Formatting\n",
    "- **Structure**: Convert the move list to a string with `str(moves_list)`.\n",
    "- **Final Output**: Prepend `\"moves = \"` to match the required format.\n",
