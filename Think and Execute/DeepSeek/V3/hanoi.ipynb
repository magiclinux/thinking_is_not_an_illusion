      "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk, and all disks must be moved to the target peg. The task is to generate the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle for a given number of disks and peg configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analyzing the Task:\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Problem**: The Tower of Hanoi problem requires moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg, adhering to the rules mentioned above.\n",
      "2. **Recursive Nature**: The problem is inherently recursive. The solution for `n` disks involves:\n",
      "   - Moving `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n",
      "   - Moving the `n-th` disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "   - Moving the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
      "3. **Move Representation**: Each move is represented as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`, where `disk` is the disk number, `from_peg` is the source peg, and `to_peg` is the target peg.\n",
      "4. **Input Parsing**: The input specifies the number of disks (`n`), the source peg, and the target peg. The auxiliary peg is inferred as the remaining peg (since there are 3 pegs in total).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Constructing the Code Prompt:\n",
      "1. **Extract Input Parameters**: Parse the input to extract `n`, the source peg, and the target peg. The auxiliary peg is calculated as `3 - source - target` (assuming pegs are numbered 0, 1, 2).\n",
      "2. **Initialize Move List**: Create an empty list to store the moves.\n",
      "3. **Recursive Move Generation**: Implement a recursive function to generate moves:\n",
      "   - Base Case: If `n == 1`, move the disk directly from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "   - Recursive Case:\n",
      "     - Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n",
      "     - Move the `n-th` disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
      "     - Move `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
      "4. **Store Moves**: Append each move to the move list in the order they are generated.\n",
      "5. **Output the Moves**: Return the list of moves in the specified format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan for Code Prompt:\n",
      "1. **Input Parsing**:\n",
      "   - Extract `n`, `source_peg`, and `target_peg` from the input string.\n",
      "   - Calculate `auxiliary_peg` as `3 - source_peg - target_peg`.\n",
      "2. **Recursive Function**:\n",
      "   - Define `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)`:\n",
      "     - If `n == 1`:\n",
      "       - Append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.\n",
      "     - Else:\n",
      "       - Call `hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)`.\n",
      "       - Append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.\n",
      "       - Call `hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)`.\n",
      "3. **Initialize and Execute**:\n",
      "   - Initialize an empty list `moves`.\n",
      "   - Call `hanoi(n, source_peg, target_peg, auxiliary_peg, moves)`.\n",
      "4. **Output**:\n",
      "   - Return `moves` in the specified format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Execution:\n",
      "For the input \"Move the $n=3$-disk Tower of Hanoi from peg $0$ to peg $2$\":\n",
      "1. Parse `n = 3`, `source = 0`, `target = 2`.\n",
      "2. Calculate `auxiliary = 3 - 0 - 2 = 1`.\n",
      "3. Call `hanoi(3, 0, 2, 1, [])`:\n",
      "   - `hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, [])`:\n",
      "     - `hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])` → Append `[1, 0, 2]`.\n",

      "     - `hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0, [])` → Append `[1, 2, 1]`.\n",
      "   - Append `[3, 0, 2]`.\n",
      "   - `hanoi(2, 1, 2, 0, [])`:\n",
      "     - `hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, [])` → Append `[1, 1, 0]`.\n",
      "     - Append `[2, 1, 2]`.\n",
      "     - `hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])` → Append `[1, 0, 2]`.\n",
      "4. Output: `moves = [[1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2]]`.\n",

    "### Analyzing the Task:\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem**: The Tower of Hanoi problem requires moving `n` disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg, adhering to the rules mentioned above.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Nature**: The problem is inherently recursive. The solution for `n` disks involves:\n",
    "   - Moving `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n",
    "   - Moving the `n-th` disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
    "   - Moving the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
    "3. **Move Representation**: Each move is represented as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`, where `disk` is the disk number, `from_peg` is the source peg, and `to_peg` is the target peg.\n",
    "4. **Input Parsing**: The input specifies the number of disks (`n`), the source peg, and the target peg. The auxiliary peg is inferred as the remaining peg (since there are 3 pegs in total).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing the Code Prompt:\n",
    "1. **Extract Input Parameters**: Parse the input to extract `n`, the source peg, and the target peg. The auxiliary peg is calculated as `3 - source - target` (assuming pegs are numbered 0, 1, 2).\n",
    "2. **Initialize Move List**: Create an empty list to store the moves.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Move Generation**: Implement a recursive function to generate moves:\n",
    "   - Base Case: If `n == 1`, move the disk directly from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
    "   - Recursive Case:\n",
    "     - Move `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n",
    "     - Move the `n-th` disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
    "     - Move `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n",
    "4. **Store Moves**: Append each move to the move list in the order they are generated.\n",
    "5. **Output the Moves**: Return the list of moves in the specified format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan for Code Prompt:\n",
    "1. **Input Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Extract `n`, `source_peg`, and `target_peg` from the input string.\n",
    "   - Calculate `auxiliary_peg` as `3 - source_peg - target_peg`.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Function**:\n",
    "   - Define `hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)`:\n",
    "     - If `n == 1`:\n",
    "       - Append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.\n",
    "     - Else:\n",
    "       - Call `hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)`.\n",
    "       - Append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.\n",
    "       - Call `hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)`.\n",
    "3. **Initialize and Execute**:\n",
    "   - Initialize an empty list `moves`.\n",
    "   - Call `hanoi(n, source_peg, target_peg, auxiliary_peg, moves)`.\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Return `moves` in the specified format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Execution:\n",
    "For the input \"Move the $n=3$-disk Tower of Hanoi from peg $0$ to peg $2$\":\n",
    "1. Parse `n = 3`, `source = 0`, `target = 2`.\n",

    "   - `hanoi(2, 0, 1, 2, [])`:\n",
    "     - `hanoi(1, 0, 2, 1, [])` → Append `[1, 0, 2]`.\n",
    "     - Append `[2, 0, 1]`.\n",
    "     - `hanoi(1, 2, 1, 0, [])` → Append `[1, 2, 1]`.\n",
    "   - Append `[3, 0, 2]`.\n",

    "     - `hanoi(1, 1, 0, 2, [])` → Append `[1, 1, 0]`.\n",
