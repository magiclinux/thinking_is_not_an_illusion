      "This task involves solving a checker jumping puzzle where red ('R') and blue ('B') checkers are initially placed on a board with an empty slot. The goal is to move all red checkers to the positions initially occupied by blue checkers and vice versa, following specific movement rules. The solution requires generating a sequence of valid moves to achieve this configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Explanation:**\n",
      "1. **Problem Understanding**:  \n",
      "   - The board has `2n + 1` slots (positions `0` to `2n`), where `n` is the number of red and blue checkers.  \n",
      "   - Initial configuration: `n` red checkers on the left, an empty slot in the middle, and `n` blue checkers on the right.  \n",
      "   - **Movement Rules**:  \n",
      "     - A checker can **slide** into an adjacent empty slot.  \n",
      "     - A checker can **jump** over an adjacent checker of the opposite color into an empty slot.  \n",
      "   - **Objective**: Swap all red and blue checkers (red moves to original blue positions and vice versa).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Observations**:  \n",
      "   - The problem resembles the **\"peg solitaire\"** or **\"traffic jam puzzle\"** where pieces must be rearranged via sliding/jumping.  \n",
      "   - The solution requires a **systematic approach** (e.g., recursive backtracking or pattern-based moves).  \n",
      "   - The sequence of moves is **deterministic** for a given `n` (no randomness).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Analyzing the Task:**\n",
      "1. **Initial Setup**:  \n",
      "   - Parse the input to extract `n` (number of checkers per color) and the initial board configuration.  \n",
      "   - Represent the board as a **list** (e.g., `['R', 'R', '_', 'B', 'B']` for `n=2`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Movement Validation**:  \n",
      "   - For each move, check:  \n",
      "     - If sliding: `to_pos` is adjacent to `from_pos` and empty.  \n",
      "     - If jumping: `to_pos` is two slots away, the middle slot has an opposite-color checker, and `to_pos` is empty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Goal State**:  \n",
      "   - The final board should mirror the initial state (e.g., `['B', 'B', '_', 'R', 'R']` for `n=2`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Move Generation**:  \n",
      "   - Use a **loop** to iteratively apply moves until the goal is reached.  \n",
      "   - Track moves in a **dictionary** (e.g., `{'R': [(1,2), ...], 'B': [(3,1), ...]}`) for debugging.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Constructing the Code Prompt:**\n",
      "1. **Parse Input**:  \n",
      "   - Extract `n` (e.g., from `$n=2$`).  \n",
      "   - Initialize the board (e.g., `['R']*n + ['_'] + ['B']*n`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define Movement Rules**:  \n",
      "   - **Slide**: Check if `abs(from_pos - to_pos) == 1` and `board[to_pos] == '_'`.  \n",
      "   - **Jump**: Check if `abs(from_pos - to_pos) == 2`, middle slot has opposite color, and `to_pos` is empty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Generate Moves**:  \n",
      "   - Use a **loop** to alternate between red and blue moves until the goal is reached.  \n",
      "   - For each step:  \n",
      "     - **Red moves right**, **Blue moves left**.  \n",
      "     - Prioritize jumps over slides (more efficient).  \n",
      "     - Log each move in a list (e.g., `moves = [['R', 1, 2], ...]`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Termination Condition**:  \n",
      "   - Stop when the board matches the goal state (e.g., `board == ['B']*n + ['_'] + ['R']*n`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output Moves**:  \n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "1. **Problem Understanding**:\n",
    "   - The board has `2n + 1` slots (positions `0` to `2n`), where `n` is the number of red and blue checkers.\n",
    "   - Initial configuration: `n` red checkers on the left, an empty slot in the middle, and `n` blue checkers on the right.\n",
    "   - **Movement Rules**:\n",
    "     - A checker can **slide** into an adjacent empty slot.\n",
    "     - A checker can **jump** over an adjacent checker of the opposite color into an empty slot.\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Swap all red and blue checkers (red moves to original blue positions and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
    "   - The problem resembles the **\"peg solitaire\"** or **\"traffic jam puzzle\"** where pieces must be rearranged via sliding/jumping.\n",
    "   - The solution requires a **systematic approach** (e.g., recursive backtracking or pattern-based moves).\n",
    "   - The sequence of moves is **deterministic** for a given `n` (no randomness).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analyzing the Task:**\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "   - Parse the input to extract `n` (number of checkers per color) and the initial board configuration.\n",
    "   - Represent the board as a **list** (e.g., `['R', 'R', '_', 'B', 'B']` for `n=2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Movement Validation**:\n",
    "   - For each move, check:\n",
    "     - If sliding: `to_pos` is adjacent to `from_pos` and empty.\n",
    "     - If jumping: `to_pos` is two slots away, the middle slot has an opposite-color checker, and `to_pos` is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Goal State**:\n",
    "   - The final board should mirror the initial state (e.g., `['B', 'B', '_', 'R', 'R']` for `n=2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Move Generation**:\n",
    "   - Use a **loop** to iteratively apply moves until the goal is reached.\n",
    "   - Track moves in a **dictionary** (e.g., `{'R': [(1,2), ...], 'B': [(3,1), ...]}`) for debugging.\n",

    "   - **Slide**: Check if `abs(from_pos - to_pos) == 1` and `board[to_pos] == '_'`.\n",

    "   - Use a **loop** to alternate between red and blue moves until the goal is reached.\n",
    "   - For each step:\n",
    "     - **Red moves right**, **Blue moves left**.\n",
    "     - Prioritize jumps over slides (more efficient).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Structured Steps**: Follows the problem-solving approach with clear steps:\n",
      "   - Input parsing\n",
      "   - Initialization\n",
      "   - Main solving loop\n",
      "   - Move selection and execution\n",
      "   - Solution verification\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Intermediate Outputs**: Uses print statements to show:\n",
      "   - Initial and goal configurations\n",
      "   - Current board state before each move\n",
      "   - Possible moves being considered\n",
      "   - Selected moves and resulting board states\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Flexible Design**:\n",
      "   - Works for any n (not hardcoded)\n",
      "   - Handles both red and blue pieces dynamically\n",
      "   - Can be extended with different move selection strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Helper Functions**:\n",
      "   - Abstracted key operations into separate functions\n",
      "   - Each function has a clear single responsibility\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Control Structures**:\n",
      "   - While loop for main solving process\n",
      "   - Conditional logic for move selection\n",
      "   - Alternates between piece colors systematically\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **State Tracking**:\n",
      "   - Maintains current board state\n",
      "   - Tracks all moves made\n",
      "   - Counts total moves\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Final Output Format**:\n",
      "   - Returns moves in the required triple format\n",
      "   - Matches the exact specification from the task\n",
      "\n",
      "The code is designed to be general and work for any instance of the checker-jumping puzzle, while providing detailed intermediate outputs to track the reasoning process. The helper functions can be implemented with specific algorithms for move generation and selection while maintaining the overall structure.\n"
