      "### **Explanation:**  \n",
      "This task involves rearranging blocks from an initial stack configuration to a goal configuration using a series of moves. Each move consists of moving a block from one stack to another. The challenge is to determine the sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Analysis of the Task:**  \n",
      "1. **State Representation:**  \n",
      "   - The initial and goal states are represented as lists of stacks (each stack is a list of blocks).  \n",
      "   - Example: `[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]` means:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: [\"A\", \"B\"] (A on top of B)\n",
      "     - Stack 1: [\"C\"]\n",
      "     - Stack 2: [] (empty)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move Definition:**  \n",
      "   - A move is defined as `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.  \n",
      "   - Example: `[\"B\", 0, 1]` means \"Move block B from Stack 0 to Stack 1.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Constraints:**  \n",
      "   - Only the top block of a stack can be moved.  \n",
      "   - Blocks cannot be placed mid-air; they must go to another stack.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Objective:**  \n",
      "   - Find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Constructing the Code Prompt:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 1: Parse Input and Initialize State**  \n",
      "- Extract `initial_state` and `goal_state` from the input.  \n",
      "- Track the current state of stacks (initially same as `initial_state`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 2: Compare Current State vs. Goal State**  \n",
      "- If they match, return an empty move list (already solved).  \n",
      "- Otherwise, proceed to find necessary moves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 3: Identify Mismatches**  \n",
      "- Compare each stack in `current_state` with `goal_state`.  \n",
      "- Track which blocks are misplaced.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 4: Plan Moves (Key Logic)**  \n",
      "- **Loop** through each stack in `goal_state`.  \n",
      "- For each block in the stack (from bottom to top):  \n",
      "  - If the block is not in the correct position:  \n",
      "    - Find its current location (`from_stack`).  \n",
      "    - Determine the correct `to_stack`.  \n",
      "    - If the target position is occupied:  \n",
      "      - Move the blocking block to a temporary stack (using **if-else** for decision-making).  \n",
      "    - Record the move `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.  \n",
      "    - Update `current_state`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 5: Return the Moves**  \n",
      "- After all moves are executed, verify that `current_state == goal_state`.  \n",
      "- Return the list of moves in the required format.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Example Execution (Plan for First Example):**  \n",
      "**Initial State:** `[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]`  \n",
      "**Goal State:** `[[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]`  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compare Stacks:**  \n",
      "   - Stack 0: `[\"A\", \"B\"]` (goal: `[\"A\"]`) → \"B\" is extra.  \n",
      "   - Stack 1: `[\"C\"]` (goal: `[\"B\"]`) → mismatch.  \n",
      "   - Stack 2: `[]` (goal: `[\"C\"]`) → missing \"C\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move \"B\" from Stack 0 to Stack 1:**  \n",
      "   - `current_state` becomes `[[\"A\"], [\"B\", \"C\"], []]`.  \n",
      "   - Move recorded: `[\"B\", 0, 1]`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Move \"C\" from Stack 1 to Stack 2:**  \n",
      "   - `current_state` becomes `[[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]`.  \n",
      "   - Move recorded: `[\"C\", 1, 2]`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Final Moves:**  \n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   moves = [[\"B\", 0, 1], [\"C\", 1, 2]]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Final Code Prompt Plan:**  \n",
      "1. **Input Parsing:**  \n",
      "   - Extract `initial_state` and `goal_state`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialization:**  \n",
      "   - `current_state = initial_state.copy()`  \n",
      "   - `moves = []`  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Main Loop (While `current_state != goal_state`):**  \n",
      "   - For each stack in `goal_state`:  \n",
      "     - For each block in the stack (bottom to top):  \n",
      "       - If the block is not in the correct place:  \n",
      "         - Find its current location (`from_stack`).  \n",
      "         - Determine `to_stack` (where it should be).  \n",
      "         - If `to_stack` is occupied:  \n",
      "           - Move the top block of `to_stack` to a temporary stack.  \n",
      "         - Record the move `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.  \n",
      "         - Update `current_state`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output:**  \n",
      "   - Return `moves` in the specified format.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Techniques Used:**  \n",
      "- **Dictionary:** Track block positions for quick lookup.  \n",
      "- **Loop:** Iterate until the goal state is reached.  \n",
      "- **If-Else:** Handle cases where a move requires intermediate steps.  \n",
      "\n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "This task involves rearranging blocks from an initial stack configuration to a goal configuration using a series of moves. Each move consists of moving a block from one stack to another. The challenge is to determine the sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis of the Task:**\n",
    "1. **State Representation:**\n",
    "   - The initial and goal states are represented as lists of stacks (each stack is a list of blocks).\n",
    "   - Example: `[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]` means:\n",
    "     - Stack 0: [\"A\", \"B\"] (A on top of B)\n",
    "     - Stack 1: [\"C\"]\n",
    "     - Stack 2: [] (empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Move Definition:**\n",
    "   - A move is defined as `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.\n",
    "   - Example: `[\"B\", 0, 1]` means \"Move block B from Stack 0 to Stack 1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Only the top block of a stack can be moved.\n",
    "   - Blocks cannot be placed mid-air; they must go to another stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Objective:**\n",
    "   - Find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial state into the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Constructing the Code Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Parse Input and Initialize State**\n",
    "- Extract `initial_state` and `goal_state` from the input.\n",
    "- Track the current state of stacks (initially same as `initial_state`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Compare Current State vs. Goal State**\n",
    "- If they match, return an empty move list (already solved).\n",
    "- Otherwise, proceed to find necessary moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Identify Mismatches**\n",
    "- Compare each stack in `current_state` with `goal_state`.\n",
    "- Track which blocks are misplaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Plan Moves (Key Logic)**\n",
    "- **Loop** through each stack in `goal_state`.\n",
    "- For each block in the stack (from bottom to top):\n",
    "  - If the block is not in the correct position:\n",
    "    - Find its current location (`from_stack`).\n",
    "    - Determine the correct `to_stack`.\n",
    "    - If the target position is occupied:\n",
    "      - Move the blocking block to a temporary stack (using **if-else** for decision-making).\n",
    "    - Record the move `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.\n",
    "    - Update `current_state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Return the Moves**\n",
    "- After all moves are executed, verify that `current_state == goal_state`.\n",
    "- Return the list of moves in the required format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Execution (Plan for First Example):**\n",
    "**Initial State:** `[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]`\n",
    "**Goal State:** `[[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compare Stacks:**\n",
    "   - Stack 0: `[\"A\", \"B\"]` (goal: `[\"A\"]`) → \"B\" is extra.\n",
    "   - Stack 1: `[\"C\"]` (goal: `[\"B\"]`) → mismatch.\n",
    "   - Stack 2: `[]` (goal: `[\"C\"]`) → missing \"C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Move \"B\" from Stack 0 to Stack 1:**\n",
    "   - `current_state` becomes `[[\"A\"], [\"B\", \"C\"], []]`.\n",
    "   - Move recorded: `[\"B\", 0, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Move \"C\" from Stack 1 to Stack 2:**\n",
    "   - `current_state` becomes `[[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]`.\n",
    "   - Move recorded: `[\"C\", 1, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Moves:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   moves = [[\"B\", 0, 1], [\"C\", 1, 2]]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Code Prompt Plan:**\n",
    "1. **Input Parsing:**\n",
    "   - Extract `initial_state` and `goal_state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `current_state = initial_state.copy()`\n",
    "   - `moves = []`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Loop (While `current_state != goal_state`):**\n",
    "   - For each stack in `goal_state`:\n",
    "     - For each block in the stack (bottom to top):\n",
    "       - If the block is not in the correct place:\n",
    "         - Find its current location (`from_stack`).\n",
    "         - Determine `to_stack` (where it should be).\n",
    "         - If `to_stack` is occupied:\n",
    "           - Move the top block of `to_stack` to a temporary stack.\n",
    "         - Record the move `[block, from_stack, to_stack]`.\n",
    "         - Update `current_state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - Return `moves` in the specified format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Techniques Used:**\n",
    "- **Dictionary:** Track block positions for quick lookup.\n",
    "- **Loop:** Iterate until the goal state is reached.\n",
    "- **If-Else:** Handle cases where a move requires intermediate steps.\n",

      "### Implementation Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The code uses 0-indexed stack numbers as specified\n",
      "2. Each move is recorded in the required [block, from_stack, to_stack] format\n",
      "3. The solution handles cases where intermediate moves are needed to clear target positions\n",
      "4. The main loop continues until current state matches goal state\n",
      "5. Print statements provide visibility into the solving process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Execution Flow:\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first example input:\n",
      "```\n",
      "Initial state: [['A', 'B'], ['C'], []]\n",
      "Goal state: [['A'], ['B'], ['C']]\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Current state: [['A', 'B'], ['C'], []]\n",
      "Next move needed: Move 'B' from stack 0 to stack 1\n",
      "Executed move: Moved 'B' from 0 to 1\n",
      "New state: [['A'], ['B', 'C'], []]\n",
      "\n",
      "Current state: [['A'], ['B', 'C'], []]\n",

      "Final state matches goal state!\n",
      "Total moves: 2\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The code prompt is designed to handle various initial and goal configurations while maintaining the same logical structure. The helper functions would need to be implemented to complete the solution, but their purposes are clearly defined in the comments.\n"
