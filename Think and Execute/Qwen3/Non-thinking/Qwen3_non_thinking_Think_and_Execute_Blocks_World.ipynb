      "### Explanation and Analysis\n",
      "The task involves rearranging blocks between stacks to match a given goal state. The challenge lies in determining a sequence of moves where each move transfers the top block of a source stack to a destination stack. The goal is to simulate the process efficiently while keeping track of intermediate states.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of the Problem\n",
      "1. **Parsing Input and Goal States**: Extract the initial and goal stack configurations from the input.\n",
      "2. **Target Mapping**: Create a mapping for each block to its target stack based on the goal state.\n",
      "3. **Move Simulation**:\n",
      "   - **Recursive Movement**: Before moving a block to its target stack, ensure that the target stack is clear of blocking blocks by recursively moving them to temporary stacks.\n",
      "   - **Temporary Stack Selection**: Choose an available stack to temporarily store blocking blocks for efficient resolution.\n",
      "4. **Edge Case Handling**: Address interdependencies between blocks that prevent direct placement in target stacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan for Code Prompt\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def block_rearrangement_moves(initial_state, goal_state):\n",
      "    # Step 1: Parse goal_state to build target_map\n",
      "    target_map = {}\n",
      "    for stack_idx, stack in enumerate(goal_state):\n",
      "        for block in stack:\n",
      "            target_map[block] = stack_idx  # Each block maps to its target stack index\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Step 2: Helper function to move a block from source to target\n",
      "    def move_block(block, source, target, initial, moves):\n",
      "        # Ensure the target stack is clear for the current block\n",
      "        while initial[target] and initial[target][-1] != target_map.get(initial[target][-1], target):\n",
      "            # Recursively move the top block of target stack\n",
      "            top_block = initial[target].pop()\n",
      "            temp_stack = 3 - source - target  # Simplified choice for temporary stack\n",
      "            move_block(top_block, target, temp_stack, initial, moves)\n",
      "        # Move the block now\n",
      "        initial[target].append(initial[source].pop())\n",
      "        moves.append([block, source, target])\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Step 3: Main move loop\n",
      "    moves = []\n",
      "    for i in range(len(initial_state)):\n",
      "        while initial_state[i]:\n",
      "            top_block = initial_state[i][-1]\n",
      "            target = target_map[top_block]\n",
      "            if i != target:\n",
      "                move_block(top_block, i, target, initial_state, moves)\n",
      "    return moves\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Logic Breakdown\n",
      "1. **Target Map Construction**:\n",
      "   - The `target_map` dictionary maps each block to its final stack index based on the goal state.\n",
      "2. **Recursive Block Movement**:\n",
      "   - The `move_block` function ensures that the target stack is clear by recursively moving any top blocks that do not belong there.\n",
      "   - If the source and target stacks overlap (e.g., both are `i` and `j`), a temporary stack is selected using a simplified heuristic (`3 - source - target`).\n",
      "3. **Main Move Loop**:\n",
      "   - Iterates through each stack's top block.\n",
      "   - If the block is not in its target stack, it initiates a move using the recursive helper function.\n",
      "4. **Efficient Use of Loops and Conditionals**:\n",
      "   - Uses `while` loops to process stacks until all blocks are moved.\n",
      "   - Conditional checks in `move_block` manage recursive movement of blocking blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Application\n",
      "For the input:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "initial = [[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]\n",
      "goal = [[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]\n",
      "```\n",
      "The code would generate moves:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "moves = [[\"C\", 1, 2], [\"B\", 0, 1]]\n",
      "```\n",
      "This ensures that each block is moved to its target stack in the correct order, resolving interdependencies efficiently.\n"

    "### Explanation and Analysis\n",
    "The task involves rearranging blocks between stacks to match a given goal state. The challenge lies in determining a sequence of moves where each move transfers the top block of a source stack to a destination stack. The goal is to simulate the process efficiently while keeping track of intermediate states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Problem\n",
    "1. **Parsing Input and Goal States**: Extract the initial and goal stack configurations from the input.\n",
    "2. **Target Mapping**: Create a mapping for each block to its target stack based on the goal state.\n",
    "3. **Move Simulation**:\n",
    "   - **Recursive Movement**: Before moving a block to its target stack, ensure that the target stack is clear of blocking blocks by recursively moving them to temporary stacks.\n",
    "   - **Temporary Stack Selection**: Choose an available stack to temporarily store blocking blocks for efficient resolution.\n",
    "4. **Edge Case Handling**: Address interdependencies between blocks that prevent direct placement in target stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan for Code Prompt\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def block_rearrangement_moves(initial_state, goal_state):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Parse goal_state to build target_map\n",
    "    target_map = {}\n",
    "    for stack_idx, stack in enumerate(goal_state):\n",
    "        for block in stack:\n",
    "            target_map[block] = stack_idx  # Each block maps to its target stack index\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 2: Helper function to move a block from source to target\n",
    "    def move_block(block, source, target, initial, moves):\n",
    "        # Ensure the target stack is clear for the current block\n",
    "        while initial[target] and initial[target][-1] != target_map.get(initial[target][-1], target):\n",
    "            # Recursively move the top block of target stack\n",
    "            top_block = initial[target].pop()\n",
    "            temp_stack = 3 - source - target  # Simplified choice for temporary stack\n",
    "            move_block(top_block, target, temp_stack, initial, moves)\n",
    "        # Move the block now\n",
    "        initial[target].append(initial[source].pop())\n",
    "        moves.append([block, source, target])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 3: Main move loop\n",
    "    moves = []\n",
    "    for i in range(len(initial_state)):\n",
    "        while initial_state[i]:\n",
    "            top_block = initial_state[i][-1]\n",
    "            target = target_map[top_block]\n",
    "            if i != target:\n",
    "                move_block(top_block, i, target, initial_state, moves)\n",
    "    return moves\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic Breakdown\n",
    "1. **Target Map Construction**:\n",
    "   - The `target_map` dictionary maps each block to its final stack index based on the goal state.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Block Movement**:\n",
    "   - The `move_block` function ensures that the target stack is clear by recursively moving any top blocks that do not belong there.\n",
    "   - If the source and target stacks overlap (e.g., both are `i` and `j`), a temporary stack is selected using a simplified heuristic (`3 - source - target`).\n",
    "3. **Main Move Loop**:\n",
    "   - Iterates through each stack's top block.\n",
    "   - If the block is not in its target stack, it initiates a move using the recursive helper function.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Use of Loops and Conditionals**:\n",
    "   - Uses `while` loops to process stacks until all blocks are moved.\n",
    "   - Conditional checks in `move_block` manage recursive movement of blocking blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Application\n",
    "For the input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "initial = [[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\"], []]\n",
    "goal = [[\"A\"], [\"B\"], [\"C\"]]\n",
