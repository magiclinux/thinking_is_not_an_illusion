      "### Explanation\n",
      "The river-crossing puzzle involves moving `n` pairs of actors (A_i) and guards (a_i) across a river using a boat with a given capacity. The key constraint is that **no actor can be left unsupervised with a guard from a different pair** on either riverbank (the boat is safe during transit). The solution requires finding a sequence of boat moves (each move lists passengers) that transports everyone from the left to the right bank without violating safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis\n",
      "1. **Problem Constraints**:\n",
      "   - **Actors and Guards**: `n` pairs (e.g., for `n=2`: A_1, A_2, a_1, a_2).\n",
      "   - **Boat Capacity**: Holds 2 or 3 people (as per input), must have ≥1 person rowing.\n",
      "   - **Safety Condition**: On any bank, if guards are present, every actor must have their own guard present.  \n",
      "     *Formally*: For actors `A` and guards `G` on a bank, if `A ≠ ∅` and `G ≠ ∅`, then `A ⊆ G` (i.e., every actor's guard is in `G`).\n",
      "   - **Goal**: All start on the left; all must end on the right, with the boat on the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Challenges**:\n",
      "   - **State Representation**: Track actors/guards on each bank and boat location.\n",
      "   - **Move Generation**: Enumerate valid passenger combinations (subsets within boat capacity).\n",
      "   - **Safety Validation**: Check banks after each move.\n",
      "   - **Search Efficiency**: Use BFS to find the shortest path without revisiting states.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Insights**:\n",
      "   - **BFS is feasible** for small `n` (≤4) due to limited state space (`2^(2n+1)` states).\n",
      "   - **State = (left_actors, left_guards, boat_side)** suffices (right bank is derivable).\n",
      "   - **Passengers** are represented as tuples `(type, id)` (e.g., `('A', 2)` for A_2).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan to Generate Code Prompt\n",
      "The code will parse `n` and boat capacity from the input, then use BFS to find a valid sequence of moves. Critical elements:\n",
      "- **`if-else`**: Handle boat direction (left→right vs. right→left) when updating states.\n",
      "- **`loop`**: Iterate over move candidates (subsets of passengers) and BFS states.\n",
      "- **`dictionary`**: Not directly used; **`sets`** track state components (actors/guards) for safety checks and visited states.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n",
      "1. **Parse Input**:\n",
      "   - Extract `n` and boat capacity using regex (e.g., `r\"n = (\\d+)\"`).\n",
      "   - Validate inputs (e.g., `n > 0`, capacity ≥ 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialize BFS**:\n",
      "   - **Initial state**: All actors/guards on left, boat on left:  \n",
      "     `(left_actors = {1, 2, ..., n}, left_guards = {1, 2, ..., n}, boat_side = 'left')`.\n",
      "   - **Goal state**: `(left_actors = ∅, left_guards = ∅, boat_side = 'right')`.\n",
      "   - **Queue**: Stores tuples `(state, path)`, where `path` is the sequence of moves.\n",
      "   - **Visited set**: Prevents cycles using state tuples `(frozenset(left_actors), frozenset(left_guards), boat_side)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Safety Check Function**:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def is_safe(actors, guards):\n",
      "     if not actors or not guards:  # Safe if no actors or no guards\n",
      "         return True\n",
      "     return actors.issubset(guards)  # Every actor has their guard\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **BFS Execution**:\n",
      "   - **While queue not empty**:\n",
      "     - Pop a state `(left_actors, left_guards, boat_side)` and its `path`.\n",
      "     - **If goal reached**: Convert `path` to output format (e.g., `[[\"A_1\", \"a_1\"], ...]`).\n",
      "     - **Generate moves** from current bank (where boat is):\n",
      "       - **Collect people**: Actors/guards on current bank as tuples:  \n",
      "         `people = {('A', i) for i in current_actors} ∪ {('a', i) for i in current_guards}`.\n",
      "       - **Subsets**: Generate all non-empty subsets of `people` with size `1` to `boat_capacity`.\n",
      "     - **For each move (subset)**:\n",
      "       - **Compute new state**:\n",
      "         - **If boat on left**: Remove passengers from left; add to right.\n",
      "         - **Else (boat on right)**: Remove from right; add to left.\n",
      "         - Toggle `boat_side`.\n",
      "       - **Check safety** for both banks using `is_safe`.\n",
      "       - **Skip unsafe or visited states**.\n",
      "       - **Push new state and path** (appending the move) to the queue.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output Conversion**:\n",
      "   - For each move, convert passenger tuples to strings (e.g., `('A', 2)` → `\"A_2\"`).\n",
      "   - Sort passengers alphabetically within a move (for consistency).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Example Execution (n=2, capacity=2)\n",
      "1. **Initial State**: `left_actors={1,2}`, `left_guards={1,2}`, `boat_side='left'`.\n",
      "2. **Valid Moves**: e.g., `{('a',1), ('a',2)}` → move both guards right.\n",
      "3. **New State**: `left_actors={1,2}`, `left_guards=∅`, `boat_side='right'` (safe: no guards left).\n",
      "4. **Next Move**: One guard returns (e.g., `{('a',1)}`), and so on.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "The river-crossing puzzle involves moving `n` pairs of actors (A_i) and guards (a_i) across a river using a boat with a given capacity. The key constraint is that **no actor can be left unsupervised with a guard from a different pair** on either riverbank (the boat is safe during transit). The solution requires finding a sequence of boat moves (each move lists passengers) that transports everyone from the left to the right bank without violating safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "1. **Problem Constraints**:\n",
    "   - **Actors and Guards**: `n` pairs (e.g., for `n=2`: A_1, A_2, a_1, a_2).\n",
    "   - **Boat Capacity**: Holds 2 or 3 people (as per input), must have ≥1 person rowing.\n",
    "   - **Safety Condition**: On any bank, if guards are present, every actor must have their own guard present.\n",
    "     *Formally*: For actors `A` and guards `G` on a bank, if `A ≠ ∅` and `G ≠ ∅`, then `A ⊆ G` (i.e., every actor's guard is in `G`).\n",
    "   - **Goal**: All start on the left; all must end on the right, with the boat on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Challenges**:\n",
    "   - **State Representation**: Track actors/guards on each bank and boat location.\n",
    "   - **Move Generation**: Enumerate valid passenger combinations (subsets within boat capacity).\n",
    "   - **Safety Validation**: Check banks after each move.\n",
    "   - **Search Efficiency**: Use BFS to find the shortest path without revisiting states.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insights**:\n",
    "   - **BFS is feasible** for small `n` (≤4) due to limited state space (`2^(2n+1)` states).\n",
    "   - **State = (left_actors, left_guards, boat_side)** suffices (right bank is derivable).\n",
    "   - **Passengers** are represented as tuples `(type, id)` (e.g., `('A', 2)` for A_2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan to Generate Code Prompt\n",
    "The code will parse `n` and boat capacity from the input, then use BFS to find a valid sequence of moves. Critical elements:\n",
    "- **`if-else`**: Handle boat direction (left→right vs. right→left) when updating states.\n",
    "- **`loop`**: Iterate over move candidates (subsets of passengers) and BFS states.\n",
    "- **`dictionary`**: Not directly used; **`sets`** track state components (actors/guards) for safety checks and visited states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n",
    "1. **Parse Input**:\n",
    "   - Extract `n` and boat capacity using regex (e.g., `r\"n = (\\d+)\"`).\n",
    "   - Validate inputs (e.g., `n > 0`, capacity ≥ 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize BFS**:\n",
    "   - **Initial state**: All actors/guards on left, boat on left:\n",
    "     `(left_actors = {1, 2, ..., n}, left_guards = {1, 2, ..., n}, boat_side = 'left')`.\n",
    "   - **Goal state**: `(left_actors = ∅, left_guards = ∅, boat_side = 'right')`.\n",
    "   - **Queue**: Stores tuples `(state, path)`, where `path` is the sequence of moves.\n",
    "   - **Visited set**: Prevents cycles using state tuples `(frozenset(left_actors), frozenset(left_guards), boat_side)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Safety Check Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def is_safe(actors, guards):\n",
    "     if not actors or not guards:  # Safe if no actors or no guards\n",
    "         return True\n",
    "     return actors.issubset(guards)  # Every actor has their guard\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **BFS Execution**:\n",
    "   - **While queue not empty**:\n",
    "     - Pop a state `(left_actors, left_guards, boat_side)` and its `path`.\n",
    "     - **If goal reached**: Convert `path` to output format (e.g., `[[\"A_1\", \"a_1\"], ...]`).\n",
    "     - **Generate moves** from current bank (where boat is):\n",
    "       - **Collect people**: Actors/guards on current bank as tuples:\n",
    "         `people = {('A', i) for i in current_actors} ∪ {('a', i) for i in current_guards}`.\n",
    "       - **Subsets**: Generate all non-empty subsets of `people` with size `1` to `boat_capacity`.\n",
    "     - **For each move (subset)**:\n",
    "       - **Compute new state**:\n",
    "         - **If boat on left**: Remove passengers from left; add to right.\n",
    "         - **Else (boat on right)**: Remove from right; add to left.\n",
    "         - Toggle `boat_side`.\n",
    "       - **Check safety** for both banks using `is_safe`.\n",
    "       - **Skip unsafe or visited states**.\n",
    "       - **Push new state and path** (appending the move) to the queue.\n",

      "To solve the River-Crossing puzzle with `n` actor-guard pairs, we need to find a sequence of boat moves that transports everyone from the left bank to the right bank while adhering to safety constraints.

      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves moving `n` pairs of actors and guards across a river using a boat with a specified capacity. The key constraint is that no actor can be left unsupervised with a guard from a different pair on any bank unless their own guard is present.\n",
      "2. **Initialization**: Parse the input to extract `n` (number of pairs) and boat capacity. Initialize the BFS queue with the starting state where all actors and guards are on the left bank.\n",
      "3. **BFS Exploration**: For each state, generate all valid moves (subsets of people on the current bank within boat capacity). For each move, compute the new state by moving the subset to the opposite bank.\n",
      "4. **Safety Check**: After each move, ensure both banks meet safety conditions. A bank is safe if either there are no actors, or every actor present has their corresponding guard present.\n",
      "5. **State Tracking**: Use a visited set to avoid revisiting the same state. If the goal state (everyone on the right bank) is reached, return the sequence of moves.\n",
      "6. **Output Conversion**: Convert the sequence of moves into the required output format, sorting passengers alphabetically within each move.\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "1. **Input Parsing**: The code starts by parsing the input text to extract the number of actor-guard pairs (`n`) and the boat capacity. If the capacity isn't explicitly mentioned, it defaults to 2 for `n ≤ 3` and 3 otherwise.\n",
      "2. **BFS Initialization**: The initial state is set with all actors and guards on the left bank. The BFS queue is initialized with this state and an empty path.\n",
      "3. **State Exploration**: For each state dequeued, the code checks if it's the goal state. If not, it generates all possible valid moves (subsets of people on the current bank within boat capacity).\n",
      "4. **Safety Validation**: Each move is validated to ensure both banks remain safe. A bank is safe if actors are either absent or accompanied by their own guards.\n",
      "5. **State Tracking**: Valid and safe states are added to the queue if they haven't been visited before. The path is updated to include the current move.\n",
      "6. **Solution Extraction**: Upon reaching the goal state, the sequence of moves is converted to the required output format, with passengers sorted alphabetically and by ID within each move.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures that the solution is found efficiently using BFS, adhering to all constraints and producing the correct sequence of moves for any valid input.\n"

      "- The initial output shows the parsed parameters (n=5, boat capacity=3) and initial/goal states.\n",
      "- The BFS starts from the initial state (all actors/guards on left) and generates 175 possible moves (all combinations of 1-3 people from the left bank).\n",
      "- The first 12 move attempts are shown (single actors/guards, and some pairs), all failing safety checks:\n",
      "  - Moving a single actor leaves the right bank unsafe (actor alone).\n",
      "  - Moving a single guard leaves the left bank unsafe (actors without their specific guard).\n",
      "- The move `['A_1','a_1']` (actor1 and guard1) is safe on both banks and is added to the queue.\n",
      "- After exploring other moves/states, BFS eventually finds a solution path. The final answer shows a valid sequence of boat trips (exact solution may vary based on move generation order, but this is a representative example). The output ends with the solution path printed.\n"
