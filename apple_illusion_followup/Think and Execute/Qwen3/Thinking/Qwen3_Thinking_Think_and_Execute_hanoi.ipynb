      "**Explanation:**  \n",
      "This task requires generating the complete sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for a given number of disks and specified source and target pegs. The challenge lies in correctly implementing the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm while explicitly tracking and logging each move step-by-step.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyzing the Task:**  \n",
      "1. **Recursion and Move Tracking:** The Tower of Hanoi problem is solved recursively by decomposing the problem into subproblems. For each recursive call, the algorithm generates intermediate moves (e.g., moving n-1 disks between pegs) and a final move for the largest disk. All these moves must be explicitly recorded.  \n",
      "2. **Input Parsing:** The input text must be parsed to extract key parameters: the number of disks (`n`), the starting peg (`source`), and the target peg (`target`).  \n",
      "3. **Output Format:** The solution must produce a list of moves in the format `[[disk, from_peg, to_peg], ...]`, with correct ordering and syntax.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Constructing the Code Prompt:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Extract Parameters from Input:**  \n",
      "   - Use string parsing (e.g., regex or substring searches) to extract `n`, `source`, and `target` from the input. Example: For input `\"Move the $n=3$-disk... from peg $0$ to peg $2$...\"`, extract `n=3`, `source=0`, `target=2`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialize Move List:**  \n",
      "   - Define a mutable list (e.g., `moves = []`) to collect all moves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recursive Function for Moves:**  \n",
      "   - Design a helper function `hanoi_moves(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)` that appends moves directly to the `moves` list.  \n",
      "     - **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.  \n",
      "     - **Recursive Case:**  \n",
      "       1. Calculate the `auxiliary` peg using `3 - source - target` (since pegs are 0, 1, and 2).  \n",
      "       2. Recursively move `n-1` disks from `source` to `auxiliary` using `target` as the auxiliary.  \n",
      "       3. Append the move for the largest disk: `[n, source, target]`.  \n",
      "       4. Recursively move `n-1` disks from `auxiliary` to `target` using `source` as the auxiliary.  \n",
      "       - **Intermediate Logging:** Use `print()` to log moves during debugging, but ensure the final `moves` list contains all steps.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Execute the Helper Function:**  \n",
      "   - Call the recursive function with the extracted `n`, `source`, `target`, and empty `moves` list.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Format the Output:**  \n",
      "   - Convert the `moves` list into a string formatted as `moves = [ [1 , 0 , 2], ... ]`, ensuring commas and spaces match the example.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Code Implementation in Python:**  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",

      "        else:\n",
      "            hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n",
      "            moves.append([n, source, target])\n",
      "            hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Step 3: Execute the helper function\n",
      "    hanoi(n, source, target, 3 - source - target)\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Step 4: Format the output\n",
      "    formatted_moves = \"moves = \" + str(moves).replace(', ', ',  ')\n",

      "print(generate_moves(example_input))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Decisions in the Plan:**  \n",
      "- **Parsing with Regex:** Regular expressions are used to extract `n`, `source`, and `target` from the input text.  \n",
      "- **Recursive Move Tracking:** The `hanoi` function recursively builds the `moves` list while ensuring the correct order of moves.  \n",
      "- **Auxiliary Peg Calculation:** The formula `3 - source - target` dynamically determines the auxiliary peg for each subproblem.  \n",
      "- **Output Formatting:** The final moves list is formatted to match the required syntax, including spaces after commas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is solved optimally, with all moves explicitly recorded and formatted as per the task's requirements.\n"

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "This task requires generating the complete sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for a given number of disks and specified source and target pegs. The challenge lies in correctly implementing the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm while explicitly tracking and logging each move step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analyzing the Task:**\n",
    "1. **Recursion and Move Tracking:** The Tower of Hanoi problem is solved recursively by decomposing the problem into subproblems. For each recursive call, the algorithm generates intermediate moves (e.g., moving n-1 disks between pegs) and a final move for the largest disk. All these moves must be explicitly recorded.\n",
    "2. **Input Parsing:** The input text must be parsed to extract key parameters: the number of disks (`n`), the starting peg (`source`), and the target peg (`target`).\n",
    "3. **Output Format:** The solution must produce a list of moves in the format `[[disk, from_peg, to_peg], ...]`, with correct ordering and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructing the Code Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Parameters from Input:**\n",
    "   - Use string parsing (e.g., regex or substring searches) to extract `n`, `source`, and `target` from the input. Example: For input `\"Move the $n=3$-disk... from peg $0$ to peg $2$...\"`, extract `n=3`, `source=0`, `target=2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Move List:**\n",
    "   - Define a mutable list (e.g., `moves = []`) to collect all moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Function for Moves:**\n",
    "   - Design a helper function `hanoi_moves(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves)` that appends moves directly to the `moves` list.\n",
    "     - **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, append `[n, source, target]` to `moves`.\n",
    "     - **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "       1. Calculate the `auxiliary` peg using `3 - source - target` (since pegs are 0, 1, and 2).\n",
    "       2. Recursively move `n-1` disks from `source` to `auxiliary` using `target` as the auxiliary.\n",
    "       3. Append the move for the largest disk: `[n, source, target]`.\n",
    "       4. Recursively move `n-1` disks from `auxiliary` to `target` using `source` as the auxiliary.\n",
    "       - **Intermediate Logging:** Use `print()` to log moves during debugging, but ensure the final `moves` list contains all steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execute the Helper Function:**\n",
    "   - Call the recursive function with the extracted `n`, `source`, `target`, and empty `moves` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Format the Output:**\n",
    "   - Convert the `moves` list into a string formatted as `moves = [ [1 , 0 , 2], ... ]`, ensuring commas and spaces match the example.\n",
