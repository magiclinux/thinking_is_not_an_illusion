      "To solve the **river-crossing puzzle** as described in Example 4, we need to generate a sequence of moves (each consisting of a list of people in a format like `\" A_2 \"` or `\" a_3 \"`) such that all **n actor-guard pairs** are transferred from one side of the river to the other while obeying the constraint: *on any bank, the number of actors (A) must not exceed the number of guards (a) if guards are present*.

      "The problem hinges on simulating all possible legal moves a boat can take (based on its capacity) while ensuring the **river-crossing constraint is maintained**. This involves modeling the world as a **state machine**, where each state represents the current configuration of people on both banks and the boat position. The transitions between states are governed by valid boat trips.\n",

      "- **Input**: Number of actor-guard pairs (`n`) and **boat capacity** (e.g., 2 or 3).\n",
      "- **Output**: A list of valid moves where each move is a list of people like `[\" A_2 \", \" a_2 \"]`.\n",
      "- **Constraints**:\n",
      "  - On any bank, if actors are present, the number of actors **must be less than or equal** to the number of guards on that same bank.\n",
      "  - Each move must respect **boat capacity**.\n",
      "  - The boat is always on one bank (left or right), and can only ferry people from its current location.\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem is a **constraint-satisfaction problem**, and a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is the ideal approach to find the minimal sequence of legal moves that leads from the **initial state** to the **goal state** (all people on the other side, with boat position also on that side).\n",

      "\n",
      "- Each actor and guard is uniquely labeled (e.g., `A_1`, `a_1`, ..., `A_n`, `a_n`).\n",
      "- A **state** is defined as:\n",
      "  - A `frozenset` for the people currently **on the left bank**.\n",
      "  - The **position** of the boat (`'left'` or `'right'`).\n",
      "- **Visited states** should be stored to prevent cycles and redundant work.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 2: Initial State Setup**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Start with all actors and guards on the **left bank** and the **boat also on the left**.\n",
      "  - E.g., for `n = 2`: `[\"A_1\", \"A_2\", \"a_1\", \"a_2\"]` all on the left bank.\n",
      "  \n",
      "#### **Step 3: Generate Valid Moves**\n",

      "From the current state:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Determine** the bank where the boat is (`left` or `right`).\n",
      "- Use `itertools.combinations` to generate all subsets of the current bank's people where the subset size is between 1 and the **boat capacity**.\n",
      "- For each valid subset:\n",
      "  - Move them to the **opposing bank**.\n",
      "  - Compute the **new left bank set** and **new boat position**.\n",
      "  - Format the subset for output (e.g., `\" A_2 \"`).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 4: Validate New State**\n",
      "\n",
      "- For both the **current** and **new** banks:\n",
      "  - Count actors and guards present.\n",
      "  - Check:\n",
      "    - If **actors > guards** and **guards > 0**, the state is invalid.\n",
      "    - If **actors > 0** and **guards == 0**, the state is also invalid.\n",
      "- Only **valid** and **unvisited** new states are queued for exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 5: Goal Check**\n",
      "\n",
      "- The goal is reached when:\n",
      "  - **All people** are on the **right bank** (i.e., `current_left == frozenset()`).\n",
      "  - The **boat is on the right bank**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 6: Tracking the Path**\n",

This involves modeling the world as a **state machine**, where each state represents the current configuration of people on both banks and the boat position.

    "- **Constraints**:\n",
    "  - On any bank, if actors are present, the number of actors **must be less than or equal** to the number of guards on that same bank.\n",
    "  - Each move must respect **boat capacity**.\n",
    "  - The boat is always on one bank (left or right), and can only ferry people from its current location.\n",

    "This problem is a **constraint-satisfaction problem**, and a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is the ideal approach to find the minimal sequence of legal moves that leads from the **initial state** to the **goal state** (all people on the other side, with boat position also on that side).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Represent the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each actor and guard is uniquely labeled (e.g., `A_1`, `a_1`, ..., `A_n`, `a_n`).\n",
    "- A **state** is defined as:\n",
    "  - A `frozenset` for the people currently **on the left bank**.\n",
    "  - The **position** of the boat (`'left'` or `'right'`).\n",
    "- **Visited states** should be stored to prevent cycles and redundant work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Initial State Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with all actors and guards on the **left bank** and the **boat also on the left**.\n",
    "  - E.g., for `n = 2`: `[\"A_1\", \"A_2\", \"a_1\", \"a_2\"]` all on the left bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Generate Valid Moves**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the current state:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Determine** the bank where the boat is (`left` or `right`).\n",
    "- Use `itertools.combinations` to generate all subsets of the current bank's people where the subset size is between 1 and the **boat capacity**.\n",
    "- For each valid subset:\n",
    "  - Move them to the **opposing bank**.\n",
    "  - Compute the **new left bank set** and **new boat position**.\n",
    "  - Format the subset for output (e.g., `\" A_2 \"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Validate New State**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For both the **current** and **new** banks:\n",
    "  - Count actors and guards present.\n",
    "  - Check:\n",
    "    - If **actors > guards** and **guards > 0**, the state is invalid.\n",
    "    - If **actors > 0** and **guards == 0**, the state is also invalid.\n",
    "- Only **valid** and **unvisited** new states are queued for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Goal Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is reached when:\n",
    "  - **All people** are on the **right bank** (i.e., `current_left == frozenset()`).\n",
    "  - The **boat is on the right bank**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 6: Tracking the Path**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain a list of moves (`path`) for each state explored.\n",

      "### ✅ **How the Code Prompt Meets Task Requirements**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Parsing**:\n",
      "   - Extracts `n` using regex from the input text, ensuring flexibility across different input formats.\n",
      "   - Automatically sets the boat capacity using an `if-else` statement based on the value of `n`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **State Representation**:\n",
      "   - Models the state as a `frozenset` of people on the left bank and a `string` indicating boat location.\n",
      "   - Uses a `deque` for BFS to explore the shortest path to the goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Move Generation**:\n",
      "   - Uses loops to generate all possible combinations of 1 to `boat_capacity` people on the current bank.\n",
      "   - For each move, prints the subset being considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **State Validation**:\n",
      "   - Ensures new states comply with the safety rule using a helper function (conceptually outlined).\n",
      "   - Adds only valid, unvisited states to the queue to prevent redundant processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Goal Tracking**:\n",
      "   - Detects when all people are on the right bank and the boat is there as well.\n",
      "   - Returns the sequence of moves in the correct format (e.g., `[[\" A_2 \", \" a_2 \"], ...]`).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Intermediate Reasoning**:\n",
      "   - Includes `print()` statements for:\n",
      "     - Extracted value of `n`, boat capacity.\n",
      "     - Initial state generation.\n",
      "     - Current state and path progress.\n",
      "     - Valid moves and updated states.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 📌 **Key Constraints Handled**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Safety Rule**: Enforced via hypothetical `is_valid_bank()` to ensure no actor is left with a foreign guard.\n",
      "- **Boat Capacity**: Dynamic based on the number of pairs in input.\n",
      "- **Path Tracking**: Maintains a list to build and return the full sequence of moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This structure enables the function to work for any instance of the puzzle with correct input parsing and dynamic configuration of the environment.\n"
