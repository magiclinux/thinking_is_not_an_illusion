      "1. **Input Parsing (`extract_initial_configuration`)**\n",
      "   - Finds the line with the phrase `\"initial configuration is\"` and extracts the sequence of checkers and `_`.\n",

      "2. **Goal State Generation (`create_goal_configuration`)**\n",
      "   - Reverses the initial configuration and swaps 'R' and 'B' to produce the mirrored goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **BFS Algorithm**\n",
      "   - Uses a queue to explore all possible board states.\n",
      "   - For each move (slide/jump), checks valid move conditions and avoids revisiting states using a `set`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Move Generation**\n",
      "   - **Red (R)** can slide to the right or jump over a **Blue (B)** piece.\n",
      "   - **Blue (B)** can slide to the left or jump over a **Red (R)** piece.\n",
      "   - Each move updates the board state and appends the move to the current move list.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Traceable Execution**\n",
      "   - **Print statements** output:\n",
      "     - Initial configuration and extracted `n`.\n",
      "     - Generated moves and updated board states.\n",
      "     - Goal state and final solution.\n",
