      "To solve the problem of rearranging blocks to reach a goal state, we construct a code prompt plan based on Breadth-First Search (BFS) to systematically explore all valid moves and find the shortest path. Below is a structured breakdown of the approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Explanation**\n",
      "The task requires transforming an initial block configuration (stacks of letters) into a goal configuration through valid moves. Each move involves transferring the top block of one stack to another. The solution must generate the sequence of moves in the format `[[block, from_stack_index, to_stack_index], ...]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Analyzing the Task**\n",
      "1. **Input Parsing**: \n",
      "   - Initial and goal states are given as lists of stacks (lists). These must be converted to tuples for immutability and hashing when tracking visited states.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **State Representation**:\n",
      "   - Represent each state as a tuple of tuples (e.g., `(('A', 'B'), ('C',), ())`).\n",
      "   - Track visited states to avoid cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Move Generation**:\n",
      "   - For each non-empty stack (`from_stack`), attempt moving its top block to any other stack (`to_stack`), generating new states.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **BFS Implementation**:\n",
      "   - Use a queue to process states level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the goal is found first.\n",
      "   - For each state, generate all valid next states by moving blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Goal Checking**:\n",
      "   - If a generated state matches the goal, return the path of moves.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Step 2: Check Immediate Solution**\n",
      "   - If the initial state already equals the goal, return an empty list.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Step 3: Initialize BFS Queue and Visited Set**\n",
      "   - Use a queue to store tuples of `(current_state, moves_list)`.\n",
      "   - Use a set to track visited states.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Step 4: BFS Loop**\n",
      "   - **While the queue is not empty**:\n",
      "     a. **Dequeue** the current state and the path taken.\n",
      "     b. **Generate all valid next states** by:\n",
      "        - Iterating over each stack as `from_stack`.\n",
      "        - For each non-empty `from_stack`, iterate over all possible `to_stacks` (excluding itself).\n",
      "        - Move the top block from `from_stack` to `to_stack`, creating a new state.\n",
      "     c. **Check if the new state is the goal**.\n",
      "        - If true, return the updated path.\n",

      "   - **Tuple Conversion** for hashing and comparison.\n",

      "3. **BFS Implementation** - Uses a queue to systematically explore all possible moves, generating new states by moving the top block from one stack to another.\n",
      "4. **Move Generation** - For each valid move, the code creates a new state, keeps track of the moves taken, and updates BFS queue as needed.\n",
      "5. **Goal Checking** - If at any point the generated state matches the goal state, the solution is returned immediately. This ensures the shortest path is found first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each step includes print statements to show the current state, moves considered, and progress through the solution process, maintaining full visibility of the algorithm's execution while remaining generalizable to any similar input.\n"
