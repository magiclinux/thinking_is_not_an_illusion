      "This task involves generating the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for a given number of disks (`n`) and start/end pegs. Each move is represented as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`, listing every step in the order they occur. The challenge lies in correctly parsing the input parameters, recursively solving the problem, and ensuring the output format aligns with the specified syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyzing the Task**  \n",
      "1. **Input Parsing**: Extract `n`, `source`, and `destination` from the input string. This requires robust regex to handle patterns like `$n=...$` and `peg $...$`.\n",
      "2. **Auxiliary Peg Calculation**: Use the remaining peg not involved in the current source and destination as the auxiliary peg.\n",
      "3. **Recursive Move Generation**: Implement a classic Tower of Hanoi recursive approach, where each move is explicitly tracked and appended to a list.\n",
      "4. **Output Format**: The moves must be formatted as a list of sublists, mimicking Python syntax with proper spacing and punctuation.\n",

      ">    - Use `r'n=(\\d+)'` to find `n` and convert it to an integer.  \n",
      ">    - Use `r'peg (\\d+)'` to find the source and destination pegs in order. If there are fewer than two peg matches, assume the default source is `0` and the destination is `2`.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      "> 2. **Calculate the Auxiliary Peg**.  \n",
      ">    - If `source` and `destination` are known, compute `auxiliary = 3 - source - destination`.  \n",

      "### Explanation of Output:\n",
      "1. **Parameter Extraction**:\n",
      "   - The code uses regex to extract `n=7`, `source=0`, and `destination=2` from the input string.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Auxiliary Peg Calculation**:\n",
      "   - The auxiliary peg is computed as `3 - source - destination = 3 - 0 - 2 = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recursive Moves**:\n",
      "   - The Tower of Hanoi problem requires `2^n - 1` moves. For `n=7`, this results in **127 moves**.\n",
      "   - Each recursive call generates `print()` statements for individual moves (e.g., moving disk `k` from one peg to another).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Generated Output**:\n",
      "   - The steps follow the standard recursive pattern:\n",
      "     1. Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary peg.\n",
      "     2. Move the nth disk from source to destination.\n",
      "     3. Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to destination.\n",
      "   - The final `moves` list contains all steps in order, formatted as `[disk, from_peg, to_peg]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Answer**:\n",
      "   - The `Final answer:` line prints the complete list of 127 moves as a Python list.\n",
      "\n",
      "This output demonstrates the correct recursive behavior of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm for `n=7`, with all steps properly logged.\n"
