      "The task is to solve a sliding puzzle where $ n $ red checkers `R` and $ n $ blue checkers `B` are initially positioned with an empty slot `_` between them. The goal is to swap their positions using valid moves. A valid move is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Move forward one step into an empty slot** (for **Red** or **Blue**).\n",
      "- **Jump over a single checker into an empty slot** (also for **Red** or **Blue**).\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is solved by simulating the board and exploring all valid move paths using a queue, ensuring we find the shortest path efficiently.\n",

      "- **Red** (`R`) can move **rightward**, with valid positions increasing by 1 or 2.\n",
      "- **Blue** (`B`) can move **leftward**, with valid positions decreasing by 1 or 2.\n",
      "- Jumps require the adjacent slot to have a checker and the destination to be an empty spot.\n",

      "   - At each step, valid moves (slide/jump) are generated based on the rules.\n",
      "   - Each new board state is checked against the visited set to avoid redundant paths.\n",
      "4. **Validation & Logging**:\n",
      "   - Each move is validated during generation.\n",
      "   - Progress and intermediate states are logged with `print()` statements.\n",
      "5. **Termination**: The search stops when the target configuration is found, returning the complete move sequence.\n",
