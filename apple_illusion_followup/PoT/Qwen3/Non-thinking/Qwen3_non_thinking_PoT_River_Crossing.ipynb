      "- **Phase 1: Move All Agents to the Right**\n",
      "  - Each agent is moved to the right side using the boat.\n",
      "  - If there are more agents remaining, one agent returns to assist in the next trip.\n",
      "  - This ensures no actors are on the left or right side during this phase.\n",

      "- **Phase 2: Bring Actors Across**\n",
      "  - For each actor, bring their agent across individually from the right to fetch them.\n",
      "  - The agent brings the actor across, then returns to the left to continue the process.\n",
      "  - The last actor is fetched separately without the agent returning.\n",
