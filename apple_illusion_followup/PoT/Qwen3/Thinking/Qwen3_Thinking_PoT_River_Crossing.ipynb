      "To solve the problem of transporting $N$ actors and their $N$ respective agents across a river in a boat that carries up to $k$ people at a time, under the restriction that **no actor can be with any other agent unless their own agent is also present**, we implement a systematic strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Key Observations:\n",
      "- An actor can only be with their own agent or alone.\n",
      "- Agents can ferry each other or themselves across without actors.\n",
      "- The strategy involves **two phases**:\n",
      "  1. Transport each actor with their agent to the right shore, return the agent to the left.\n",
      "  2. Use the agents to transfer from left to right, which is safe now because **all actors are already across and each actor is alone**, and thus the constraints are satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Step-by-Step Strategy:\n",
      "1. **Phase 1**: For each actor-agent pair from $N$ to 1:\n",
      "   - Move agent $A_i$ and actor $a_i$ together to the right shore.\n",
      "   - Return agent $A_i$ alone to the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phase 2**: Move the $N$ agents from left to right in batches of size $k$, using only agents:\n",
      "   - No actors are left unattended in either location at this point.\n",
      "   - Agents are allowed to travel in groups since no actors are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Code Implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def solution(N, k):\n",
      "    moves = []\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Phase 1: Move each actor and their agent across\n",
      "    for i in range(N, 0, -1):\n",
      "        moves.append([f\"A_{i}\", f\"a_{i}\"])  # A_i and a_i go right\n",
      "        moves.append([f\"A_{i}\"])            # A_i returns to left\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Phase 2: Move agents from left to right\n",
      "    agents = [f\"A_{i}\" for i in range(1, N + 1)]\n",
      "\n",
      "    for i in range(0, N, k):\n",
      "        batch = agents[i:i + k]\n",
      "        moves.append(batch)\n",
      "\n",
      "    return moves\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Example: $N = 2, k = 2$\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "[\n",
      "    [\"A_2\", \"a_2\"],\n",
      "    [\"A_2\"],\n",

      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### ✅ Explanation of Movement Validity:\n",
      "At every step:\n",
      "- Actors are only with their own agent or alone.\n",
      "- Agents can travel freely in groups, as actors are not present.\n",
      "- All transitions are valid according to the constraint that an actor **must not be in the presence of any other agent** without their own agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
