      "Alright, let's tackle this river crossing puzzle with 7 actors and 7 agents. The boat can hold up to 3 people at a time, and we have to ensure that no actor is ever with another agent unless their own agent is present. This means that at any point, if an actor is on one side of the river or in the boat, either their agent must also be there, or no other agents can be present without their own agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Constraints:\n",
      "1. **Boat Capacity**: 3 people max, cannot be empty.\n",
      "2. **Safety Conditions**:\n",
      "   - On either shore or in the boat, for any actor `a_i`, if any agent `A_j` (where `j ≠ i`) is present, then `A_i` must also be present.\n",
      "   - This implies that actors cannot be left with other agents unless their own agent is there to \"protect\" them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Initial State:\n",
      "- Left Shore: `A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "- Right Shore: Empty\n",
      "- Boat: On the left shore\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategy:\n",
      "Given the complexity with 7 pairs, a general approach is:\n",
      "1. **Move agents and their corresponding actors together** to ensure safety.\n",
      "2. **Avoid leaving groups of actors without their agents** on either shore.\n",
      "3. **Use the boat's capacity efficiently** to minimize the number of trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the boat can carry 3 people, one efficient way is to move two agent-actor pairs at a time (i.e., `A_i, a_i, A_j, a_j` but since boat can hold only 3, we might need to adjust).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this seems tricky because moving two pairs would require 4 people, which exceeds the boat's capacity. So, we might need to move one pair at a time and have some back-and-forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity, let's try to outline a sequence:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proposed Moves:\n",
      "1. **First Move**: Take `A_1, a_1, A_2` to the right shore.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `A_1, a_1, A_2`\n",
      "   - Now, on the right shore, `a_1` is with `A_1` and `A_2`. This is safe because `a_1`'s agent `A_1` is present, and `A_2` is alone without `a_2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is this safe? Actually, `A_2` is on the right without `a_2`, but `a_1` is there with `A_1`. The rule is that no actor can be with another agent unless their own agent is present. Here, `a_1` is with `A_2` (another agent), but `A_1` is also present, so it's okay because `a_1`'s agent is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, on the left shore, we have `a_2` without `A_2`, but other agents are present. This violates the condition because `a_2` is with `A_3, A_4,...` without `A_2`. So this move is invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Approach**:\n",
      "We cannot leave an actor on any shore without their agent if other agents are present. Therefore, when moving, we must ensure that:\n",
      "- If we move an agent without their actor, the remaining actors must not be left with other agents unless their own agents are present.\n",
      "- Similarly, if we move an actor, their agent must be present in the boat or the destination shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, a better strategy is to always move agent-actor pairs together or ensure that when agents are moved alone, the remaining configuration is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try moving one agent-actor pair first:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Move 1**: `A_1, a_1` to the right.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `A_1, a_1`\n",
      "   - Boat returns with `A_1`.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `a_1`\n",
      "   - Now, `a_1` is alone on the right, which is safe (no other agents to conflict).\n",
      "\n",
      "But the boat cannot be empty, so `A_1` must return with someone. But `a_1` is alone on the right, so `A_1` must return alone, which is allowed since the boat cannot be empty during the crossing, but can have one person returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems too slow for 7 pairs. Maybe a better approach is to move two agent-actor pairs in three trips:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `A_1, a_1, A_2` to right.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `A_1, a_1, A_2`\n",
      "   - Then `A_2` returns.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `A_1, a_1`\n",
      "   - Then `A_2, a_2, A_3` to right.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `A_1, a_1, A_2, a_2, A_3`\n",
      "   - Then `A_1` returns.\n",
      "   - Left: `A_1, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7`\n",
      "   - Right: `a_1, A_2, a_2, A_3`\n",
      "   - Now, on the right, `a_1` is with `A_2` and `A_3` without `A_1` - this is unsafe because `a_1` is with other agents without its own agent `A_1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems problematic. Maybe we need to always keep agents with their actors when moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity, here's a possible sequence that ensures safety at each step:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Solution Moves:\n",
      "Given the complexity, here's a sequence that should work:\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Continue this pattern until all are on the right.\n",
