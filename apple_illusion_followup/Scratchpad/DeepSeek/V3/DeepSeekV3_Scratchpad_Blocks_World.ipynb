      "Alright, let's tackle this block-stacking puzzle step by step. I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I find the minimum sequence of moves to reach the goal state from the initial state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "**Initial State:**\n",
      "- Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (top)\n",
      "- Stack 1: (empty)\n",
      "- Stack 2: (empty)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Goal State:**\n",
      "- Stack 0: A, B, C (top)\n",
      "- Stack 1: D, E (top)\n",
      "- Stack 2: F, G (top)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rules:**\n",
      "1. Only the topmost block of any stack can be moved.\n",
      "2. A block can be placed on an empty stack or on top of another block.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analyzing the Goal State\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's see what the goal state requires:\n",
      "- Stack 0 should have A, B, C in order from bottom to top.\n",
      "- Stack 1 should have D, E.\n",
      "- Stack 2 should have F, G.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the initial state, Stack 0 has all blocks from A to G in order. We need to distribute some of these blocks to Stack 1 and Stack 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identifying Necessary Moves\n",
      "\n",
      "To get from the initial state to the goal state, we need to:\n",
      "1. Keep A, B, C in Stack 0.\n",
      "2. Move D and E to Stack 1.\n",
      "3. Move F and G to Stack 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since only the top block can be moved, and initially G is on top, we'll need to move blocks in a way that allows us to access the blocks beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Moves\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start moving blocks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial State:**\n",
      "   - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n",
      "   - Stack 1: \n",
      "   - Stack 2: \n",
      "\n",
      "   Top block is G on Stack 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move G to Stack 2:**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"G\", 0, 2]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E, F\n",
      "     - Stack 1: \n",
      "     - Stack 2: G\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Now top of Stack 0 is F. Move F to Stack 1:**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"F\", 0, 1]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E\n",
      "     - Stack 1: F\n",
      "     - Stack 2: G\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Top of Stack 0 is E. We need E in Stack 1 eventually, but currently Stack 1 has F, and we can't place E on F (since in goal state E is below F in Stack 1, but currently F is alone). Wait, goal state has Stack 1 as D, E, meaning E is on top of D, and F is in Stack 2. So my previous move was incorrect because F should be in Stack 2, not Stack 1.**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Oops, I see a mistake here. In the goal state, F and G are both in Stack 2, not F in Stack 1 and G in Stack 2. Let me backtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Correct goal:\n",
      "   - Stack 0: A, B, C\n",
      "   - Stack 1: D, E\n",
      "   - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "   So F and G should both be in Stack 2, with G on top of F.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Let me restart from the initial state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Corrected Step-by-Step Moves\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial State:**\n",
      "   - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E, F, G\n",
      "   - Stack 1: \n",
      "   - Stack 2: \n",
      "\n",
      "   Top is G on Stack 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move G to Stack 2:**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"G\", 0, 2]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E, F\n",
      "     - Stack 1: \n",
      "     - Stack 2: G\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Top of Stack 0 is F. Move F to Stack 2 (on top of G):**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"F\", 0, 2]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E\n",
      "     - Stack 1: \n",
      "     - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "   Now Stack 2 has F, G as desired in the goal state.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Top of Stack 0 is E. We need E in Stack 1, but Stack 1 is empty. Move E to Stack 1:**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"E\", 0, 1]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, D\n",
      "     - Stack 1: E\n",
      "     - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Top of Stack 0 is D. We need D in Stack 1 under E. Currently, Stack 1 has E, so we can't place D under E directly. We need to move E out of the way first.**\n",
      "\n",
      "   So, move E from Stack 1 to Stack 2 (but Stack 2 has F, G; can't place E on G since in goal state E is not in Stack 2). Alternatively, move E to Stack 0, but Stack 0 has D on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Wait, no: Stack 0 has D on top, so we can't place E on D. Only option is to place E on Stack 2 on top of G, but that's not in the goal state. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Maybe a better approach is to not move E to Stack 1 yet. Let me backtrack to step 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "   After step 3:\n",
      "   - Stack 0: A, B, C, D, E\n",
      "   - Stack 1: \n",
      "   - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "   Instead of moving E to Stack 1, let's move D to Stack 1 first.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Alternative step 4: Move D to Stack 1:**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"D\", 0, 1]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C, E\n",
      "     - Stack 1: D\n",
      "     - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Now top of Stack 0 is E. Move E to Stack 1 (on top of D):**\n",
      "   - Move: [\"E\", 0, 1]\n",
      "   - New state:\n",
      "     - Stack 0: A, B, C\n",
      "     - Stack 1: D, E\n",
      "     - Stack 2: F, G\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we've reached the goal state!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Verifying the Moves\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's list all the moves we made:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Move G from Stack 0 to Stack 2.\n",
      "2. Move F from Stack 0 to Stack 2.\n",
      "3. Move D from Stack 0 to Stack 1.\n",
      "4. Move E from Stack 0 to Stack 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final state:\n",
      "- Stack 0: A, B, C\n",
      "- Stack 1: D, E\n",
      "- Stack 2: F, G\n",
