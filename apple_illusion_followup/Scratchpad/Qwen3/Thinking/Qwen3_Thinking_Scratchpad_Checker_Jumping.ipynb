    "Task Description: On a one-dimensional board, there are red checkers (’R’), blue checkers (’B’), and one empty space (’_’). A checker can move by either:\n",
    "1. Sliding forward into an adjacent empty space, or\n",
    "2. Jumping over exactly one checker of the opposite color to land in an empty space. The goal is to swap the positions of all red and blue checkers, effectively mirroring the initial state.\n",
    "Example: If the initial state is [’R’, ’_’, ’B’], the goal is to reach [’B’, ’_’, ’R’]. Your solution should be a list of moves where each move is represented as [checker_color, position_from, position_to]. For example:\n",
    "moves = [[ ’R ’ , 0 , 1] , [ ’B ’ , 2 , 0] , [ ’R ’, 1 , 2]]\n",
    "This means: Move the red checker from position 0 to 1, then move the blue checker from position 2 to 0, and so on.\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "• When exploring potential solutions in your thinking process, always include the corresponding complete list of moves.\n",
    "• The positions are 0-indexed (the leftmost position is 0).\n",
    "• Ensure your final answer includes the complete list of moves for final solution in the format: moves = [[checker_color, position_from, position_to], ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a puzzle with 15 positions, where 7 red checkers (’R’) on left, 7 blue checkers (’B’) on right, and one empty space (’_’) in between are arranged in a line.\n",
    "Initial board: R R ... R _ B B ... B\n",
    "Goal board: B B ... B _ R R ... R\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "• A checker can slide into an adjacent empty space.\n",
    "• A checker can jump over exactly one checker of the opposite color to land in an empty space.\n",
    "• Checkers cannot move backwards (towards their starting side).\n",

    "\n",
    "Scratchpad Description: When solving the puzzle, the output solution may be extremely long. The real puzzle you will receive may involve many more objects, so a complete solution can contain **hundreds of moves**. Thus, you can choose when to pause your output and save your current state to a scratchpad. In your next round of conversation, you can use the scratchpad to recover your memory of the current round.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scratchpad budget: You may write to the scratchpad at most **5 times total** in the whole dialogue. A counter will be provided in each user message. If you exceed the budget, all your output will be ignored. No matter how many times we use the scratchpad in our examples, you can feel free to use it 0 to 5 times based on your own decision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Output: In each round of conversation, you must follow **this exact interface** on every turn (no extra keys, no prose outside JSON) to answer the puzzle and use the scratchpad.\n",

    "If you want to use the scratchpad and start a new round, you can return:\n",
