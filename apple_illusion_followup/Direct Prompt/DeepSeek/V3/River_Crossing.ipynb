      "Alright, let's tackle this river crossing puzzle step by step. We have 7 actors (a₁ to a₇) and their corresponding 7 agents (A₁ to A₇). The boat can hold up to 3 people at a time, and it cannot travel empty. The main constraint is that no actor can be in the presence of another agent unless their own agent is also present. This means:\n",
      "\n",
      "- An actor aᵢ can only be with agent Aⱼ if j = i (i.e., their own agent).\n",
      "- Therefore, if an actor is on one side of the river or in the boat without their own agent, no other agent can be present there unless that agent is also accompanied by their own actor (which complicates things since an agent can't be with another actor without their own actor being present).\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems similar to the classic \"missionaries and cannibals\" problem but with more complex constraints. Here's how I'll approach it:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Agent Presence**: An agent Aᵢ can be with any number of actors as long as for every actor aⱼ present, their agent Aⱼ is also present. But since each agent is only responsible for one actor, this likely means that if an actor is present, their specific agent must be present to \"protect\" them from other agents.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Wait, the exact wording is: \"no actor can be in the presence of another agent, including while riding the boat, unless their own agent is also present\". So, for any actor aᵢ, if any other agent Aⱼ (j ≠ i) is present, then Aᵢ must also be present.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This implies that if an actor is with any other agent, their own agent must be there. So, in any group containing actors and agents:\n",
      "   - For every actor aᵢ in the group, their agent Aᵢ must also be in the group if any other agent is present.\n",
      "   - Alternatively, if no other agents are present (only actors), then it's okay because no \"other\" agents are present to cause a conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "   But the first interpretation seems more accurate: if an actor is with any agent (other or same), their own agent must be present to \"protect\" them from other agents. But this seems circular because if an actor is with their own agent, then other agents can't be there unless their own actors are present, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Maybe it's simpler: in any group (boat or shore), for every actor aᵢ present, if any agent Aⱼ is present (including possibly Aᵢ), then Aᵢ must be present. So, if an actor is present, their agent must be present if any agents are present at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This seems complex. Maybe a better way is: in any group, the set of agents present must be exactly the agents corresponding to the actors present. That is, the agents present are a subset of {Aᵢ | aᵢ is present}.\n",
      "\n",
      "   So, if actors a₁ and a₂ are present, then only A₁ and/or A₂ can be present, no other agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Boat Rules**: The boat can carry up to 3 people, and cannot be empty. So each move involves 1 to 3 people crossing the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Initial State\n",
      "\n",
      "Left Bank: a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅, a₆, a₇, A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄, A₅, A₆, A₇\n",
      "Right Bank: empty\n",
      "Boat: on the left\n",
      "\n",
      "### Goal State\n",
      "\n",
      "All on the right bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the constraints, it's probably necessary to always keep actors with their own agents when other agents are around. One way to ensure this is to have actors always travel with their own agents, and avoid having multiple agents without their corresponding actors in the same place unless it's safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the symmetry, maybe we can pair each actor with their agent and have them move together. But since the boat can carry 3, we can have multiple pairs moving at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's think step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Moves\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's think about who can be in the boat together. The boat is a \"group\" that must satisfy the constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 1: Only agents in the boat. Any number of agents up to 3 is fine since no actors are present to cause conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 2: Actors and agents in the boat. For each actor in the boat, their agent must also be in the boat if any other agents are present. So if we have actor a₁ and agent A₂, that's invalid unless A₁ is also present.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, valid boat combinations:\n",
      "- Any group of 1-3 agents.\n",
      "- An actor and their agent (and possibly others, but must ensure constraints).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, let's try to move groups where we don't leave actors with other agents without their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Attempting a Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's try to move agents first, ensuring that on either shore, the constraints are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 1: Take 3 agents to the right.\n",
      "- Boat: [A₁, A₂, A₃] to right.\n",
      "Now left: a₁-a₇, A₄-A₇\n",
      "right: A₁-A₃\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, someone must return. If an agent returns, no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 2: A₁ returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₁-a₇, A₁, A₄-A₇\n",
      "right: A₂, A₃\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can we take more agents? Let's take A₁, A₄, A₅ to right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 3: [A₁, A₄, A₅] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₁-a₇, A₆, A₇\n",
      "right: A₁-A₅\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, need to return. If A₂ returns:\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 4: A₂ returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₁-a₇, A₂, A₆, A₇\n",
      "right: A₁, A₃-A₅\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can we take actors? Let's try taking a₁ with A₂ (since A₂ is a₁'s agent? Wait no, A₁ is a₁'s agent. So a₁ can only be with A₁ unless no other agents are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "On left, agents present are A₂, A₆, A₇. So a₁ cannot be with them unless A₁ is present, but A₁ is on the right. So cannot have a₁ with A₂, A₆, or A₇ unless A₁ is there, which it's not. So cannot move a₁ with any agents on left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly for other actors. So cannot move any actors from left unless we have their agent present, which we don't (their agents are on right).\n",
      "\n",
      "So this path seems stuck. Maybe initial approach is flawed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternative Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe always move actor with their agent. Let's try moving a₁ and A₁ first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 1: [a₁, A₁] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₂-a₇, A₂-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, A₁\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, someone must return. A₁ returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 2: [A₁] returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₂-a₇, A₁-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can we move another pair? a₂ and A₂.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 3: [a₂, A₂] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₃-a₇, A₁, A₃-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₂, A₂\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, A₂ returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 4: [A₂] returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₃-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₃-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₂\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to be making slow progress. With 7 pairs, this will take many moves. Maybe we can move more at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 5: [a₃, A₃, a₄, A₄] - but boat can only take 3. So [a₃, A₃, a₄] - but then a₄ is with A₃ without A₄, which violates the rule (a₄ is with A₃, so A₄ must be present, but it's not). So cannot do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative: [a₃, A₃, A₄] - a₃ is with A₄, so A₃ must be present, which it is. So this is okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 5: [a₃, A₃, A₄] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₄-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₅-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₂, a₃, A₂, A₃, A₄\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, need to return. A₄ returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 6: [A₄] returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₄-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₄, A₅-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₂, a₃, A₂, A₃\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can we move more? Maybe [a₄, A₄, a₅].\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 7: [a₄, A₄, a₅] to right.\n",
      "But a₅ is with A₄ without A₅, which violates the rule. So no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative: [a₄, A₄, A₅] - a₄ is with A₅, so A₄ must be present, which it is. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 7: [a₄, A₄, A₅] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₅-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₆, A₇\n",
      "right: a₁-a₄, A₂-A₅\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, A₅ returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 8: [A₅] returns to left.\n",
      "Left: a₅-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₅, A₆, A₇\n",
      "right: a₁-a₄, A₂-A₄\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to be progressing, but very slowly. Given the number of pairs, this method would take an impractical number of moves. There must be a more efficient way.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optimized Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity, perhaps the most straightforward way is to always move two agents and one actor at a time, ensuring that the actor is with their own agent when other agents are present. Here's a possible sequence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Move two agents and one actor where the actor's agent is one of the two agents.\n",
      "   - For example, move A₁, A₂, a₁.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 1: [A₁, A₂, a₁] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₂-a₇, A₃-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, A₁, A₂\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, A₁ and A₂ cannot be left without a₁ unless a₁ is not with other agents, but a₁ is on the right with A₁ and A₂, which is okay since A₁ is present for a₁.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, return A₁ and A₂.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 2: [A₁, A₂] return to left.\n",
      "Left: a₂-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₃-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, move another group similarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 3: [A₃, A₄, a₃] to right.\n",
      "Left: a₂, a₄-a₇, A₁, A₂, A₅-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₃, A₃, A₄\n",
      "\n",
      "Return A₃ and A₄.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move 4: [A₃, A₄] return to left.\n",
      "Left: a₂, a₄-a₇, A₁-A₄, A₅-A₇\n",
      "right: a₁, a₃\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue this pattern until all actors are on the right, then ferry the remaining agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this still seems lengthy. Given the time, here's a possible sequence that should work, though it may not be the minimal number of moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Solution Moves\n",
      "\n",
